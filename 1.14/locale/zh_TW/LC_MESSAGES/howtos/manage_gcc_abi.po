"In version 5.1, GCC released libstdc++, which introduced a `new library ABI "
"<https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html>`_ that "
"includes new implementations of ``std::string`` and ``std::list``. These "
"changes were necessary to conform to the 2011 C++ standard which forbids "
"Copy-On-Write strings and requires lists to keep track of their size."

"When Conan creates the default profile the first time it runs, it adjusts "
"the ``compiler.libcxx`` setting to ``libstdc++`` for backwards "
"compatibility. However, if you are using GCC >= 5 your compiler is likely to "
"be using the new CXX11 ABI by default (libstdc++11)."

"If you are using the :ref:`CMake build helper <cmake_reference>` or the :ref:"
"`AutotoolsBuildEnvironment build helper <autotools_reference>` Conan will "
"automatically adjust the ``_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI`` flag to manage the ABI."
