"Conan is a decentralized package manager with a client-server architecture. "
"This means that clients can fetch packages from, as well as upload packages "
"to, different servers (“remotes”), similar to the “git” push-pull model to/"
"from git remotes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:19
msgid ""
"On a high level, the servers are just package storage. They do not build nor "
"create the packages. The packages are created by the client, and if binaries "
"are built from sources, that compilation is also done by the client "
"application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:29
msgid "The different applications in the image above are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:31
msgid ""
"The **Conan client**: this is a console/terminal command line application, "
"containing the heavy logic for package creation and consumption. Conan "
"client has a local cache for package storage, and so it allows you to fully "
"create and test packages offline.  You can also **work offline** so long as "
"no new packages are needed from remote servers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:35
msgid ""
"The **Conan server**: this is a TCP server that can be easily run as your "
"**own server on-premises** to host your private packages. It is also a "
"service application that can be run as a daemon or service, behind a web "
"server (apache, nginx), or easily as stand-alone application. Both the Conan "
"client and the conan_server are OSS, MIT license, so you can use them for "
"free in your company, customize them, or redistribute them without any legal "
"issue."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:40
msgid ""
"**JFrog** `Artifactory <https://jfrog.com/artifactory/>`_ offers Conan "
"repositories; so it can also be used as an on-premises server. It is a more "
"powerful solution, featuring a WebUI, multiple auth protocols, High "
"Availability, etc. It also has cloud offerings that will allow you to have "
"private packages without having any on-premises infrastructure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:44
msgid ""
"**JFrog** `Bintray <https://bintray.com/>`_ provides a public and free "
"hosting service for OSS Conan packages. Users can create their own "
"repositories under their accounts and organizations, and freely upload Conan "
"packages there, without moderation. You should, however, take into account "
"that those packages will be public, and so they must conform to the "
"respective licenses, especially if the packages contain third party code. "
"Just reading or retrieving Conan packages from Bintray, doesn't require an "
"account, an account is only needed to upload packages. Besides that, Bintray "
"provides a central repository called `conan-center <https://bintray.com/"
"conan/conan-center>`_ which is moderated, and packages are reviewed before "
"being accepted to ensure quality."

msgid "Binary management"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:57
msgid ""
"One of the most powerful features of Conan is that it can manage pre-"
"compiled binaries for packages. To define a package, referenced by its name, "
"version, user and channel, a package recipe is needed. Such a package recipe "
"is a conanfile.py python script that defines how the package is built from "
"sources, what the final binary artifacts are, the package dependencies, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:67
msgid ""
"When a package recipe is used in the Conan client, and a “binary package” is "
"built from sources, that binary package will be compatible with specific "
"settings, such as the OS it was created for, the compiler and compiler "
"version, or the computer architecture. If the package is built again from "
"the same sources but with different settings, (e.g. for a different "
"architecture), a new, different binary will be generated. By the way, "
"“binary package” is in quotes because, strictly, it is not necessarily a "
"binary. A header-only library, for example, will contain just the headers in "
"the “binary package”."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:75
msgid ""
"All the binary packages generated from a package recipe are managed and "
"stored coherently. When they are uploaded to a remote, they stay connected. "
"Also, different clients building binaries from the same package recipe (like "
"CI build slaves in different operating systems), will upload their binaries "
"under the same package name to the remotes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:80
msgid ""
"Package consumers (client application users that are installing existing "
"packages to reuse in their projects) will typically retrieve pre-compiled "
"binaries for their systems in case such compatible binaries exist. Otherwise "
"those packages will be built from sources on the client machine to create a "
"binary package matching their settings."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:88
msgid ""
"Conan works and is being actively used on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, "
"RedHat, ArchLinux, Raspbian), OSX, FreeBSD, and SunOS, and, as it is "
"portable, it might work in any other platform that can run python. In the "
"documentation, examples for a specific OS might be found, such as :command:"
"`conan install . -s compiler=\"Visual Studio\"`, which will be specific for "
"Windows users. If on a different system, the reader should adapt to their "
"own platform and settings (for example :command:`conan install . -s "
"compiler=gcc`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:93
msgid ""
"Also **Conan works with any build system**. In the documentation, CMake will "
"be widely used, because it is portable and well known. But Conan does not "
"depend on CMake at all; it is not a requirement. **Conan is totally "
"orthogonal to the build system**. There are some utilities that improve the "
"usage of popular build systems such as CMake or Autotools, but they are just "
"helpers. Furthermore, it is not necessary that all the packages are built "
"with the same build system. It is possible to depend on packages created "
"with other build system than the one you are using to build your project."

msgid "Stable"

#: ../../../introduction.rst:107

"From Conan 1.0, there is a commitment to stability, not breaking user space "
"while evolving the tool and the platform. This means:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:109
msgid ""
"Moving forward to following minor versions 1.1, 1.2, …, 1.X should never "

"Configuration and automatic tools detection, like the detection of the "

"The compatibility is always considered forward. New APIs, tools, methods, "

"versions."

"This means that public repositories, like conan-center assume the use of the "
