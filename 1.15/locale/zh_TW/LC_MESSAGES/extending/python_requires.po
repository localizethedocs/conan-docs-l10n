msgid ""
"They are required at every step of the Conan commands. If you are creating a "

"should already be available in the local cache or be downloaded from the "
"remotes. Otherwise, Conan will raise a \"missing package\" error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../extending/python_requires.rst:148
msgid ""
"They do not affect the package binary ID (hash). Depending on different "
"version, or different channel of such ``python_requires()`` do not change "
"the package IDs as the normal dependencies do."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../extending/python_requires.rst:150
msgid ""
"They are imported only once. The Python code that is reused is imported only "
"once, the first time it is required. Subsequent requirements of that Conan "
"recipe will reuse the previously imported module. Global initialization at "
"parsing time and global state are discouraged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../extending/python_requires.rst:153
msgid ""
"They are transitive. One recipe using ``python_requires()`` can also be "
"consumed with a ``python_requires()`` from another package recipe."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../extending/python_requires.rst:155
msgid ""
"They are not automatically updated with the ``--update`` argument from "
"remotes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../extending/python_requires.rst:156
msgid ""
"Different packages can require different versions in their "
"``python_requires()``. They are private to each recipe, so they do not "
"conflict with each other. However, it is the responsibility of the user to "
"maintain consistency."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../extending/python_requires.rst:158
msgid ""
"They are not overridden from downstream consumers. Again, as they are "
"private, they are not affected by other packages, even consumers"
