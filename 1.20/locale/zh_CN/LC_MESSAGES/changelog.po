"New **conan remote** command to manage remotes. Redesigned remotes "
"architecture, now allows to work with several remotes in a more consistent, "
"powerful and \"git-like\" way. New remotes registry keeps track of the "
"remote of every installed package, and this information is shown in :command:"
