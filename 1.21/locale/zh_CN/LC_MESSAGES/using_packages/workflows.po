"When working with a  single configuration, your conanfile will be quite "
"simple as shown in the examples and tutorials we have used so far in this "
"user guide. For example, in :ref:`Getting started<getting_started>`, we "
"showed how you can run the :command:`conan install ..` command inside the "
"*build* folder resulting in the *conaninfo.txt* and *conanbuildinfo.cmake* "
"files being generated there too. Note that the build folder is temporary, so "
"you should exclude it from version control to exclude these temporary files."
