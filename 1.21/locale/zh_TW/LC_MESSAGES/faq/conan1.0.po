"There are quite a few things that will break existing usage (compared to "
"0.30). Most of these are in command line arguments, so they are relatively "
"easy to fix. The most important one is that now, most commands require the "
"path to the conanfile folder or file, instead of using ``--path`` and ``--"
"file`` arguments. Specifically, :command:`conan install`, :command:`conan "
"export` and :command:`conan create` are the ones most affected:"
