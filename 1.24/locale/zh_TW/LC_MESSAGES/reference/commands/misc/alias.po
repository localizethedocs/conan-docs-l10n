"An \"alias\" package is a symbolic name (reference) for another package "
"(target). When some package depends on an alias, the target one will be "
"retrieved and used instead, so the alias reference, the symbolic name, does "
"not appear in the final dependency graph."

"Such package recipe acts as a \"proxy\" for the aliased reference. Users "
"depending on ``hello/0.X@user/testing`` will actually use version "
"``hello/0.1@user/testing``. The alias package reference will not appear in "
"the dependency graph at all. It is useful to define symbolic names, or "
"behaviors like \"always depend on the latest minor\", but defined upstream "
"instead of being defined downstream with ``version-ranges``."
