"There are several ways to download and run Artifactory CE. The simplest one "
"might be to download and unzip the designated zip file, though other "
"installers, including also installing from a Docker image. When the file is "
"unzipped, launch Artifactory by double clicking the .bat or .sh script in "
"the *bin* subfolder, depending on the OS. Java 8 update 45 or later runtime "
"is required. If you don't have it, please install it first (newer Java "
"versions preferred)."
