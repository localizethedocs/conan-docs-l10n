"The difference between MSYS2 and CYGWIN is that MSYS2 is oriented to the "

"Building software in a Windows subsystem for a different compiler than MinGW "
"can sometimes be painful. The reason is how the subsystem finds your "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../systems_cross_building/windows_subsystems.rst:67
msgid ""
"For example, the `icu <http://site.icu-project.org>`_ library requires "
"Visual Studio to be built in Windows, but also a subsystem able to build the "
"Makefile. A very common problem and example of the pain is the ``link.exe`` "
"program. In the Visual Studio suite, ``link.exe`` is the linker, but in the "
"``MSYS2`` environment the ``link.exe`` is a tool to manage symbolic links."
