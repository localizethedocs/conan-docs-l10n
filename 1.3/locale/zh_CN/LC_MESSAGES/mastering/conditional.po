"The **configure** method might be used to hardcode dependencies options "
"values. It is strongly discouraged to use it to change the settings values, "
"please remember that ``settings`` are a configuration *input*, so it doesn't "
"make sense to modify it in the recipes."

"Also, for options, a more flexible solution is to define dependencies "
"options values in the ``default_options``, not in the ``configure()`` "
"method, as this would allow to override them. Hardcoding them in the "
"``configure()`` method won't allow that and thus won't easily allow conflict "
"resolution. Use it only when it is absolutely necessary that the package "
"dependencies use those options."
