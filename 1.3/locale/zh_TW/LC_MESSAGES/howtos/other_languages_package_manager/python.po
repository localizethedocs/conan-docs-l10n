"Conan is a C and C++ package manager, and to deal with the vast variability "
"of C and C++ build systems, compilers, configurations, etc., it was designed "
"with a great flexibility in mind, trying to let the users do almost what "
"they want. This is one of the reasons to use Python as the scripting "
"language for Conan package recipes."

"With this flexibility, Conan is able to do very different tasks: package "
"`Visual Studio modules <https://blog.conan.io/2016/06/01/Building-and-"
"packaging-C++-modules-in-VS2015.html>`_, :ref:`package Go code "
"<go_package_manager>`, build packages from sources or from binaries "
"retrieved from elsewhere, etc."

"The real utility of this is that Conan is a C and C++ package manager. So if "
"we want to create a python package that wraps the functionality of, lets say "
"the Poco C++ library, it can be easily done. Poco itself has transitive (C/C+"
"+) dependencies, but they are already handled by Conan. Furthermore, a very "
"interesting thing is that nothing has to be done in advance for that "
"library, thanks to useful tools as **pybind11**, that allows to create "
"python bindings easily."
