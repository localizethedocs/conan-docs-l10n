msgid ""
"Packaging header-only libraries is similar to other packages. Be sure to "
"start by reading and understanding the :ref:`packaging getting started "
"guide<packaging_getting_started>`. The main difference is that a package "
"recipe is typically much simpler. There are different approaches depending "
"on if you want Conan to run the library unit tests while creating the "
"package or not. Full details are described :ref:`in this how-to "
"guide<header_only>`."

msgid ""
"While creating a package, you may want to add different configurations and "
"variants of the package. There are two main inputs that define packages: "
"settings and options. Read more about them in :ref:`this "
"section<settings_vs_options>`."

"The search model for Conan in commands such as :command:`conan install` and :"
"command:`conan info` is done from the downstream or \"consumer\" package as "
"the starting node of the dependency graph and upstream."

msgid ""
"The inverse model (from upstream to downstream) is not simple to obtain for "
"Conan packages. This is because the dependency graph is not unique, it "
"changes for every configuration. The graph can be different for different "
"operating systems or just by changing some package options. So you cannot "
"query which packages are dependent on ``my_lib/0.1@user/channel``, but which "
"packages are dependent on ``my_lib/0.1@user/channel:63da998e3642b50bee33`` "
"binary package. Also, the response can contain many different binary "
"packages for the same recipe, like ``my_dependent/0.1@user/channel:"
"packageID1... ID2... my_dependent/0.1@user/channel:packageIDN``. That is the "
"reason why :command:`conan info` and :command:`conan install` need a profile "
"(default profile or one given with ``--profile```) or installation files "
"``conanbuildinfo.txt`` to look for settings and options."

#: ../../../faq/using.rst:39
msgid ""
"In order to show the inverse graph model, the bottom node is needed to build "
"the graph upstream and an additional node too to get the inverse list. This "
"is usually done to get the build order in case a package is updated. For "
"example, if we want to know the build order of the Poco dependency graph in "
"case OpenSSL is changed we could type:"

"The *outdated* status is computed from the recipe hash, comparing the hash "
"of the recipe used to create a binary package and the current recipe. The "
"recipe hash is the hash of all the files included in the *conanmanifest.txt* "
"file (you can inspect this file in your cache with :command:`conan get <ref> "
"conanmanifest.txt`). The first value in the manifest file is a timestamp and "
"is not taken into account to compute the hash. Checking and comparing the "

"The ``<user>`` term in a Conan reference is basically a namespace to avoid "
