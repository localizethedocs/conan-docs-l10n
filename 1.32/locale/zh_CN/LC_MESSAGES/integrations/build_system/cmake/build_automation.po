"You can invoke CMake from your conanfile.py file and automate the build of "
"your library/project. Conan provides a ``CMake()`` helper. This helper is "
"useful in calling the ``cmake`` command both for creating Conan packages or "
"automating your project build with the :command:`conan build .` command. The "
"``CMake()`` helper will take into account your settings in order to "
"automatically set definitions and a generator according to your compiler, "
"build_type, etc."
