"Thanks to the invaluable help of our community we manage to develop and "
"maintain a free extension for Visual Studio in the Microsoft Marketplace, it "
"is called **Conan Extension for Visual Studio** and it provides integration "
"with Conan using the :ref:`Visual Studio generators "
"<visualstudio_generator>`."

"You can install it into your IDE using the **Extensions manager** and start "
"using it right away. This extension will look for a *conanfile.py* (or "
"*conanfile.txt*) and retrieve the requirements declared in it that match "
"your build configuration (it will build them from sources if no binaries are "
"available)."

"In version ``1.0`` of the extension, the algorithm to look for the "
"*conanfile.py* (preferred) or *conanfile.txt* is very naïve: It will start "
"looking for those files in the directory where the **Visual Studio project "
"file** is located and then it will walk recursively into parent directories "
"to look for them."

"The extension creates a property sheet file and adds it to the project, so "
"all the information from the dependencies handled by Conan should be added "
"(as inherited properties) to those already available in your projects."

"At this moment (release ``v1.0.x``) the extension is under heavy "
"development, some behaviors may change and new features will be added. You "
"can subscribe to `its repository`_ to stay updated and, of course, any "
"feedback about it will be more than welcome."
