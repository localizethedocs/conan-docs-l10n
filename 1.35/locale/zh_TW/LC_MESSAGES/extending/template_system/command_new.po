"Using the Conan command :command:`conan new` is a very convenient way to "
"start a new project with a example `conanfile.py`. This command has a ``--"
"template`` argument you can use to provide a path to a template file for the "
"``conanfile.py`` itself or even a path to a folder containing files for a C+"
"+ project using Conan recipes."

"The argument ``--template`` can take an absolute path or a relative path. If "
"relative, Conan will look for the files starting in the Conan cache folder "
"``templates/command/new/``, this is very useful in combination with :ref:"
