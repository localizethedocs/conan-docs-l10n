"If you have an IDE that supports Python and may do linting automatically, "

"Conan provides a plugin which makes pylint aware of these dynamic fields and "
"their types. To use it when running pylint outside Conan, just add the "

"There is also a \"recipe_linter\" hook in the `official hooks repository "
"<https://github.com/conan-io/hooks>`_ that can be activated to run automatic "
"linter checks on the recipes when they are exported to the conan cache "
"(``export``, ``create`` and ``export-pkg`` commands). Read the hook "
"documentation for details. You could also write your own custom linter hook "
"to provide your own recipe quality checks."
