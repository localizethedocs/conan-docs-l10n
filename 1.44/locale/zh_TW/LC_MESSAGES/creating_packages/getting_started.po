"This is a **tutorial** section. You are encouraged to execute these "
"commands. For this concrete example, you will need **CMake** installed  in "
"your path. It is not strictly required by Conan to create packages, you can "
"use other build systems (as VS, Meson, Autotools and even your own) to do "
"that, without any dependency to CMake. Some of the features used in this "
"section are **experimental**, like ``CMakeToolchain`` or ``cmake_layout()``, "
"and they might change in future releases. There are other alternative tools "
"that are stable, please check the :ref:`reference section<references>` for "
"more information."
