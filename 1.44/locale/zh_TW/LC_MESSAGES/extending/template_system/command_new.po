"Using the Conan command :command:`conan new` is a very convenient way to "
"start a new project with an example `conanfile.py`. This command has a ``--"
"template`` argument that you can use to provide a path to a template file "
"for the ``conanfile.py`` itself or even a path to a folder containing files "
"for a C++ project using Conan recipes."
msgstr ""

"The argument ``--template`` can take an absolute path or a relative path. If "
"relative, Conan will look for the files starting in the Conan cache folder "
"``templates/command/new/``. This is very useful in combination with :ref:"
"`conan_config_install` because you can easily share these templates with all "
"your team."

"For backwards compatibility reasons, if the ``--template`` argument takes "
