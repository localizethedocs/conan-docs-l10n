"Conan needs access to some per user configuration files, such as the **conan."
"conf** file that defines the basic client app configuration. By convention, "
"this file will be located in the user home folder **~/.conan/**. This folder "
"will also typically store the package cache in **~/.conan/data**. Even "
"though the latter is configurable in *conan.conf*, Conan needs some place to "
"look for this initial configuration file."

"Continuous Integration (CI) environments, in which multiple jobs can also "

"instances (virtual machines), or with sequential jobs is perfectly possible. "
"For example, we use a lot CI cloud services of travis-ci and appveyor."

"Using different caches is very simple. You can just define the environment "
"variable **CONAN_USER_HOME**. By setting this variable to different paths, "
"you have multiple conan caches, something like python \"virtualenvs\". Just "
"changing the value of **CONAN_USER_HOME**, you can switch among isolated "
"Conan instances that will have independent package storage caches, and also "
"different user credentials, different user default settings, and different "

"Conan local cache support some degree of concurrency, allowing simultaneous "

"The concurrency is implemented with a Readers-Writers lock mechanism, which "
"in turn uses ``fasteners`` library file locks to achieve multi-platform "
"portability. As this \"mutex\" resource is by definition not enough to "

"loop is necessary. However, this time sleeps will be rare, only sleeping "
"when there is actually a collision and waiting on a lock."
