"The definitions of the folders is different if it is a multi-config "
"generator (like Visual Studio or Xcode), or a single-config generator (like "
"Unix Makefiles). In the first case, the folder is the same irrespective of "
"the build type, and the build system will manage the different build types "

"This helper defines a few things, for example that the source folder is "
