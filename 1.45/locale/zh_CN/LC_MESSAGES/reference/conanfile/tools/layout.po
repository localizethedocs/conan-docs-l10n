"The predefined layouts define a few things, for example in the "
"``cmake_layout()`` the source folder is  called ``\".\"``, meaning that "
"Conan will expect the sources in the same directory where the conanfile is "
"(most likely the project root, where a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file will be "
"typically found). This could be customized without fully changing the layout:"
