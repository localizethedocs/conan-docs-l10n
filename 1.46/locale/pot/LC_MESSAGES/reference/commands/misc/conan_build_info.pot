"Some problems regarding the use of BuildInfo with Conan packages `have been "
"reported <https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-9343>`_. If the BuildInfo "
"contains artifacts that have the same checksum as other artifacts, this may "
"result in losing the path of the artifact in the BuildInfo in Artifactory "
"and also fail in the promotion process."
