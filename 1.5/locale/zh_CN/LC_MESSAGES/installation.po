"Conan can be installed in many Operating Systems. It has been extensively "
"used and tested in Windows, Linux (different distros), OSX, and is also "
"actively used in FreeBSD and Solaris SunOS. There are also several "

"The preferred and **strongly recommended way to install Conan** is from "

"There are other available installers for different systems, which might come "
"with a bundled python interpreter, so that you don't have to install python "
"first. Note that some of **these installers might have some limitations**, "
"specially those created with pyinstaller (such as Windows exe & Linux deb)."

"To install Conan using ``pip``, you need Python 2.7 or 3.X distribution "
"installed on your machine. Modern Python distros come with pip pre-"
"installed. However, if necessary you can install pip by following the "
"instructions in `pip docs`_."

"Python 2 will soon be deprecated by the Python maintainers. It is strongly "
"recommended to use Python 3 with Conan, especially if need to manage non-"
"ascii filenames or file contents. Conan still supports Python 2, however "
"some of the dependencies have started to be supported only by Python 3. The "
"roadmap for deprecating Python 2 support in Conan will be defined soon."
