"Conan needs access to some, per user, configuration files, as the **conan."
"conf** file that defines the basic client app configuration. By convention, "
"this file will be located in the user home folder **~/.conan/**. This folder "
"will typically also store the package cache, in **~/.conan/data**. Though "
"the latter is configurable in *conan.conf*, still conan needs some place to "
"look for this initial configuration file."

"Continuous Integration (CI) environments, in which multiple jobs can also "
"work concurrently. Moreover, these environments would typically want to run "
"with different user credentials, different remote configurations, etc. Note "
"that using Continuous Integration with the same user, with isolated machine "
"instances (virtual machines), or with sequential jobs is perfectly possible. "
"For example, we use a lot CI cloud services of travis-ci and appveyor."

"Independent per project management and storage. If as a single developer you "
"want to manage different projects with different user credentials (for the "
"same remote, having different users for different remotes is also fine), "
"consuming packages from different remotes, you might find that having a "
"single user configuration is not enough. Having independent caches might "
"allow also to take away with you very easily the requirements of a certain "
"project."

"Using different caches is very simple. You can just define the environment "
"variable **CONAN_USER_HOME**. By setting this variable to different paths, "
"you have multiple conan caches, something like python \"virtualenvs\". Just "
"changing the value of **CONAN_USER_HOME** you can switch among isolated "
"conan instantes that will have independent package storage caches, but also "
"different user credentials, different user default settings, and different "
"remotes configuration."

"Conan local cache support some degree of concurrency, allowing simultaneous "

"The concurrency is implemented with a Readers-Writers lock mechanism, which "

"portability. As this \"mutex\" resource is by definition not enough to "
"implement a Readers-Writers solution, some active-wait with time sleeps in a "
"loop is necessary. However, this time sleeps will be rare, only sleeping "
"when there is actually a collision and waiting on a lock."
