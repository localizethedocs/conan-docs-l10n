"These tools are still **experimental** (so subject to breaking changes) but "
"with very stable syntax. We encourage the usage of it to be prepared for "
"Conan 2.0. The ``layout()`` feature will be fully functional only in the new "
"build system integrations (:ref:`in the conan.tools space <conan_tools>`). "
"If you are using other integrations, they might not fully support this "
"feature."

"The pre-defined layouts define the Conanfile ``.folders`` and ``.cpp`` "

"`layout()<conanfile_layout>` method. For example in the ``cmake_layout()`` "
"the source folder is  called ``\".\"``, meaning that Conan will expect the "
"sources in the same directory where the conanfile is (most likely the "
"project root, where a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file will be typically found). If "
"you have a different folder where the ``CMakeLists.txt`` is located, you can "
