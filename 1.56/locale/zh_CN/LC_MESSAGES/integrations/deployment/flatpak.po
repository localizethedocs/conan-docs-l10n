"`Flatpak <https://flatpak.org>`_ (former ``xdg-app``) is a package "

"The major advantage of ``Flatpak`` is sandboxing: each application runs in "
"its own isolated environment. ``Flatpak`` provides fine-grained control to "
"system resources (e.g. network, bluetooth, host filesystem, etc.). "
"``Flatpak`` also offers a set of runtimes for various Linux desktop "
"applications, e.g. `Freedesktop <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/>`_, "
"`GNOME <https://www.gnome.org>`_ and `KDE <https://kde.org>`_."
