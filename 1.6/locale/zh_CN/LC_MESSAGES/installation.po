"Conan can be installed in many Operating Systems. It has been extensively "

"There are other available installers for different systems, which might come "
"with a bundled python interpreter, so that you don't have to install python "

"To install Conan using ``pip``, you need Python 2.7 or 3.X distribution "
"installed on your machine. Modern Python distros come with pip pre-"
"installed. However, if necessary you can install pip by following the "
"instructions in `pip docs`_."

"Python 2 will soon be deprecated by the Python maintainers. It is strongly "
"recommended to use Python 3 with Conan, especially if need to manage non-"
"ascii filenames or file contents. Conan still supports Python 2, however "
"some of the dependencies have started to be supported only by Python 3. See "
"`python2`_ deprecation notice for details."
