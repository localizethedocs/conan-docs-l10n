"Searches package recipes and binaries in the local cache or in a remote. If "
"you provide a pattern, then it will search for existing package recipes "
"matching it. If a full reference is provided (pkg/0.1@user/channel) then the "
"existing binary packages for that reference will be displayed. If no remote "
"is specified, the serach will be done in the local cache. Search is case "
"sensitive, exact case has to be used. For case insensitive file systems, "
"like Windows, case sensitive search can be forced with '--case-sensitive'."
