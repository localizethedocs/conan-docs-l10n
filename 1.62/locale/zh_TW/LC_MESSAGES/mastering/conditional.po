"The ``configure()`` method might be used to hardcoded values for options of "

"Also, for options, a more flexible solution is to define dependencies "
"options values in the ``default_options``, not in the ``configure()`` "
"method. Setting the values in ``configure()`` won't allow to override them "
"and it will make really hard (even impossible) to resolve some conflicts. "

"This approach is the first one evaluated when Conan loads the recipe so it "
