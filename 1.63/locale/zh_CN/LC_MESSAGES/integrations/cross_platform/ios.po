"One example of a tool requires implementing a toolchain to cross-compile to "
"iOS, tvOS or watchOS, is the `Darwin Toolchain <https://github.com/"
"theodelrieu/conan-darwin-toolchain>`_  package. Although this package is not "
"in Conan Center Index you can check it to see an example of how to use a "
"toolchain for cross-compilation by using a tool requires. You can use a "
"profile like the following to cross-build your packages for ``iOS``,  "
"``watchOS`` and ``tvOS``:"
