":ref:`MesonToolchain<conan-meson-toolchain>` normally works together with :"
"ref:`PkgConfigDeps<PkgConfigDeps>` to manage all the dependencies, but "
"sometimes we need to gather some flags coming from ``Autotools`` tool so "
"that's what ``MesonDeps`` is meant for. In other words, it is typically used "
"when Meson cannot find a dependency using the already known `detection "
"mechanisms <https://mesonbuild.com/Dependencies.html>`__ like: `pkg-config`, "
"`cmake`, `config-tool`, etc. For instance, if we'd have these lines in your "
"`meson.build` file, you might need ``MesonDeps`` to find that dependency and "
"inject the correct flags to the compiler:"
