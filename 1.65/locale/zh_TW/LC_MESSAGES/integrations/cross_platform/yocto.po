"The `Yocto Project`_ is an open-source project that delivers a set of tools "

"Yocto supports several Linux host distributions and it also provides a way "
"to install the correct version of these tools by either downloading a "
"buildtools-tarball or building one on a supported machine. This allows "
"virtually any Linux distribution to be able to run Yocto, and also makes "
"sure that it will be possible to replicate your Yocto build system in the "
"future. The Yocto Project build system also isolates itself from the host "
"distribution's C library, which makes it possible to share build caches "
"between different distributions and also helps in future-proofing the build "
"system."
