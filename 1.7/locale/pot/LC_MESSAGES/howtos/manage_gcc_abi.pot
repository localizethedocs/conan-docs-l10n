"In the GCC 5.1 release libstdc++ introduced a `new library ABI <https://gcc."
"gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html>`_ that includes new "
"implementations of ``std::string`` and ``std::list``. These changes were "
"necessary to conform to the 2011 C++ standard which forbids  Copy-On-Write "
"strings and requires lists to keep track of their size."

"When Conan create the default profile the first time it runs, adjust the "
