"It is possible that your project's *CMakeLists.txt* has already defined some "
"functionality that extracts the artifacts (headers, libraries, binaries) "
"from the build and source folder to a predetermined place and does the post-"
"processing (*e.g.*, strips rpaths). For example, one common practice is to "
"use CMake `install <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/install."
"html>`_ directive to that end."

"The following excerpt shows how to build and package with CMake within "

"The ``package_info()`` method specifies the list of the necessary libraries, "
"defines and flags for different build configurations for the consumers of "
"the package. This is necessary as there is no possible way to extract this "
"information from the CMake install automatically."

"Please mind that if you use ``cmake.install()`` in ``package()``, it will be "
"called twice if you are using :ref:`no_copy_source` attribute in your "
"conanfile."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CMake usually uses ``install`` directive to package both the artifacts and "
"source code (*i.e.* header files) into the package folder. Hence calling "
"``package()`` twice, while having no side effects, is wasting a couple of "
"cycles, since source code is already copied in the first invocation of "
"``package()`` and the install step will be done twice. Files will be simply "
"overwritten, but install steps are sometimes time-expensive and this doubles "
"the \"packaging\" time."

"This might be unintuitive if you only use CMake, but mind that Conan needs "
"to cater to many different build systems and scenarios (*e.g.* where you "
"don't control the CMake configuration directly) and hence this workflow is "
"indispensable."
