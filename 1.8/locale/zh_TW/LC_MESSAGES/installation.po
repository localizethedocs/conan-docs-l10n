"Conan can be installed in many Operating Systems. It has been extensively "

"There are other available installers for different systems, which might come "

"To install Conan using ``pip``, you need Python 2.7 or 3.X distribution "

"installed. However, if necessary you can install pip by following the "

"Python 2 will soon be deprecated by the Python maintainers. It is strongly "
"recommended to use Python 3 with Conan, especially if need to manage non-"
"ascii filenames or file contents. Conan still supports Python 2, however "
"some of the dependencies have started to be supported only by Python 3. See :"
