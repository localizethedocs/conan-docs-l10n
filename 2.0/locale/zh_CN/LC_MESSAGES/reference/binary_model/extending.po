msgid ""
"**Settings** are a project-wide configuration, something that typically "
"affects the whole project that is being built and affects the resulting "
"package binaries. For example, the operating system or the architecture "
"would be naturally the same for all packages in a dependency graph, linking "
"a Linux library to build a Windows app, or mixing architectures is "
"impossible. Settings cannot be defaulted in a package recipe. A recipe for a "
"given library cannot say that its default is ``os=Windows``. The ``os`` will "
"be given by the environment in which that recipe is processed. It is a "
"mandatory input to be defined in the input profiles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../reference/binary_model/extending.rst:74
msgid ""
"On the other hand, **options** are a package-specific configuration that "
"affects the resulting package binaries. Static or shared library are not "
"settings that apply to all packages. Some can be header only libraries while "
"other packages can be just data, or package executables. For example, "
"``shared`` is a common option (the default for specifying if a library can "
"be static or shared), but packages can define and use any options they want. "
"Options are defined in the package ``conanfile.py`` recipe, including their "
"supported and default values with ``options`` and ``default_options``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../reference/binary_model/extending.rst:79
msgid ""
"Configuration via ``conf`` is intended for configuration that does not "
"affect the resulting package binaries in the general case. For example, "
"building one library with the ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:generator=Ninja`` "
"shouldn't result in a binary different than if built with Visual Studio "
"(just a typically faster build thanks to Ninja)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../reference/binary_model/extending.rst:83

"There are some exceptions to the above. For example, settings can be defined "

"This will use ``gcc`` for \"mypkg\" and ``clang`` for the rest of the "
