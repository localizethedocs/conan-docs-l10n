"For recipes and build scripts for open source, publicly available libraries, "
"it is common practice to download the sources from a canonical source, like "
"Github releases, or project download web pages. Keeping a record of the "
"origin of these files is useful for traceability purposes, however, it is "
"often not guaranteed that the files will be available in the long term, and "
"a user in the future building the same recipe from source may encounter a "
"problem. Conan can thus be configured to transparently retrieve sources from "
"a configured mirror, without modifying the recipes or `conandata.yml`. "
"Additionally, these sources can be transparently uploaded alongside the "
"packages via :command:`conan upload`."
