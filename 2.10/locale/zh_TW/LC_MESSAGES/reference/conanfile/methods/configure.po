"The ``configure()`` method should be used for the configuration of settings "
"and options in the recipe for later use in the different methods like "
"``generate()``, ``build()`` or ``package()``. This method executes while "
"building the dependency graph and expanding the packages dependencies, which "
"means that when this method executes the dependencies are still not there, "
"they do not exist, and it is not possible to access ``self.dependencies``."

"For example, for a C (not C++) library, the ``compiler.libcxx`` and "
"``compiler.cppstd`` settings shouldn't even exist during the ``build()``. It "
"is not only that they are not part of the ``package_id``, but they shouldn't "
"be used in the build process at all. They will be defined in the profile, "
"because other packages in the graph can be C++ packages and need them, but "
"it is the responsibility of this recipe to remove them so they are not used "
"in the recipe:"
