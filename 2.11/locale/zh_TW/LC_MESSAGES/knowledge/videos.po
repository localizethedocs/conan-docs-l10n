"Conan 2.0 was released over a year ago with a large number of new features "
"and improvements. Since its release, the team has continued to add "
"improvements based on user feedback, releasing many more new features than "
"in the previous years combined. Join Diego and Luis from the Conan team for "
"an overview of practical examples of what Conan 2 can do for your C and C++ "
"package management development workflows. Some highlights include: "
"transparent fall back to system-provided dependencies, managing metadata "
"files, and the flexible and fully transparent CMake integrations, and more!"

"During the years since Conan 1.0 was released, we have continued to learn "
"from the C++ ecosystem as we watched it grow; learning many lessons, "
"challenges and trends in the industry from the feedback from tens of "
"thousands of conversations with users and customers, including many of the "
"largest C++ related companies in the world. This talk summarizes some of "
"these lessons and how they have been used to create the new major version of "
