"The previous section used ``--build=missing`` to build all the necessary "
"packages in the same CI machine. This is not always desired, or even "
"possible, and in many situations it is preferable to do a distributed build, "
"to achieve faster builds and better usage the CI resources. The most natural "
"distribution of the build load is to build different packages in different "
"machines. Let's see how this is possible with the ``conan graph build-"
"order`` command."

"The ``--reduce`` argument eliminates all elements in the resulting order "
