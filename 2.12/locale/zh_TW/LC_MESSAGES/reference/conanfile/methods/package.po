"The ``package()`` method is in charge of copying files from the "
"``source_folder`` and the temporary ``build_folder`` to the "
"``package_folder``, copying only those files and artifacts that will be part "
"of the final package, like headers, compiler static and shared libraries, "
"executables, license files, etc."

"The ``package()`` method will be called once per different configuration "
"that is creating a new package binary, which happens with ``conan install --"

"There are 2 main ways the ``package()`` method can do such a copy. The first "
