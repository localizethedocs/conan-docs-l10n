"Conan 2 comes with many exciting improvements based on the lessons learned "
"in the last years with Conan 1.X. Also, a lot of effort has been made to "
"backport necessary things to Conan 1.X to make the upgrade easier: Recipes "
"using latest 1.X integrations will be compatible with Conan 2, and binaries "
"for both versions will not collide and be able to live in the same server "
"repositories."

"A new modular Python API is made available, public and documented. This is a "

"for different functional groups, like ``api.list``, ``api.search``, ``api."
"remove``, ``api.profile``, ``api.graph``, ``api.upload``, ``api.remotes``, "

"Conan 2 allows extending Conan with custom user commands, written in python "

"Conan 2 has redesigned the CLI for better consistency, removing ambiguities, "
"and improving the user experience. The new CLI also sends all the "
"information, warning, and error messages to stderr, while keeping the final "
"result in stdout, allowing multiple output formats like ``--format=html`` or "
"``--format=json`` and using redirects to create files ``--format=json > "
"myfile.json``. The information provided by the CLI will be more structured "
"and thorough so that it can be used more easily for automation, especially "

msgid "New deployers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew.rst:60
msgid ""
"Conan 2 implements “deployers”, which can be called in the command line as "
"``conan install …. --deployer=mydeploy``, typically to perform copy "
"operations from the Conan cache to user folders. Such deployers can be built-"
"in (“full_deploy”, “direct_deploy” and \"runtime_deploy\" are provided so "
"far), or user-defined, which can be shared and managed with ``conan config "
"install``. Deployers run before generators, and they can change the target "
"folders. For example, if the ``--deployer=full_deploy`` deployer runs before "
"``CMakeDeps``, the files generated by ``CMakeDeps`` will point to the local "
"copy in the user folder done by the ``full_deploy`` deployer, and not to the "
"Conan cache."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew.rst:62
msgid ""
"Deployers can be multi-configuration. Running ``conan install . --"
"deployer=full_deploy`` repeatedly for different profiles, can achieve a "
"fully self-contained project, including all the artifacts, binaries, and "
"build files that is completely independent of Conan and no longer require "
"Conan at all to build."
msgstr ""

msgid "New package_id"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew.rst:67
msgid ""
"Conan 2 defines a new, dynamic ``package_id`` that is a great improvement "
"over the limitations of Conan 1.X. This ``package_id`` will take into "
"account the package types and types of requirements to implement a more "
"meaningful strategy, depending on the scenario. For example, it is well "
"known that when an application ``myapp`` is linking a static library "
"``mylib``, any change in the binary of the static library ``mylib`` requires "
"re-building the application ``myapp``. So Conan will default to a mode like "
"``full_mode`` that will generate a new ``myapp`` ``package_id``, for every "
"change in the ``mylib`` recipe or binary. While a dependency between a "
"static library ``mylib_a`` that is used by ``mylib_b`` in general does not "
"imply that a change in ``mylib_b`` always needs a rebuild of ``mylib_a``, "
"and that relationship can default to a ``minor_mode`` mode. In Conan 2, the "
"one doing modifications to ``mylib_a`` can better express whether the "
"consumer ``mylib_b`` needs to rebuild or not, based on the version bump "
"(patch version bump will not trigger a rebuild while a minor version bump "
"will trigger it)"
msgstr ""

"Furthermore the default versioning scheme in Conan has been generalized to "
"any number of digits and letters, as opposed to the official “semver” that "

"Conan 2 features a new extension mechanism to define binary compatibility at "
"a global level. A ``compatibility.py`` file in the Conan cache will be used "
"to define which fallbacks of binaries should be used in case there is some "
"missing binary for a given package. Conan will provide a default one to "
"account for ``cppstd`` compatibility, and executables compatibility, but "
"this extension is fully configurable by the user (and can also be shared and "

"Lockfiles in Conan 2 have been greatly simplified and made way more "

"The new configuration system called ``[conf]`` in profiles and command line, "
"and introduced experimentally in Conan 1.X, is now the major mechanism to "
"configure and control Conan behavior. The idea is that the configuration "
"system is used to transmit information from Conan (a Conan profile) to Conan "
"(A Conan recipe, or a Conan build system integration like "
"``CMakeToolchain``). This new configuration system can define strings, "
"boolean, lists, being cleaner, more structured and powerful than using "
"environment variables. A better, more explicit environment management, also "
"introduced in Conan 1.X is now the way to pass information from Conan "
"(profiles) to tools (like compilers, build systems)."
