"Package promotions are the recommended devops practice to handle quality, "
"maturity or stages of packages in different technologies, and of course, "
"also for Conan packages."

"The principle of package promotions is that there are multiple server "
"package repositories defined and packages are uploaded and copied among "
"repositories depending on the stage. For example we could have two different "
"server package repositories called \"testing\" and \"release\":"

"Using different ``user/channel`` to try to denote maturity is strongly "
"discouraged. It was described in the early Conan 1 days years ago, before "
"the possibility of having multiple repositories, but it shouldn't be used "
"anymore."

"Packages should be completely immutable accross pipelines and stages, a "
"package cannot rename or change its ``user/channel``, and re-building it "
"from source to have a new ``user/channel`` is also a strongly discourage "
"devops practice."

"Between those repositories there will be some quality gates. In our case, "
"some packages will be put in the \"testing\" repository, for the QA team to "
"test them, for example ``zlib/1.3.1`` and ``openssl/3.2.2``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devops/package_promotions.rst:77
msgid ""
"When the QA team tests and approves these packages, they can be promoted to "
"the \"release\" repository. Basically, a promotion is a copy of the "
"packages, including all the artifacts and metadata from the \"testing\" to "
"the \"release\" repository."

"There are different ways to implement and execute a package promotion. "
"Artifactory has some APIs that can be used to move individual files or "
"folders. The `Conan extensions repository <https://github.com/conan-io/conan-"
"extensions>`_ contains the ``conan art:promote`` command that can be used to "
"promote Conan \"package lists\" from one server repository to another "
"repository."

"If we have a package list ``pkglist.json`` that contains the above "

"In modern package servers such as Artifactory package artifacts are "
"**deduplicated**, that is, they do not take any extra storage when they are "
"copied in different locations, including different repositories. The "
"**deduplication** is checksum based, so the system is also smart to avoid re-"
"uploading existing artifacts. This is very important for the \"promotions\" "
"mechanism: this mechanism is only copying some metadata, so it can be very "
"fast and it is storage efficient. Pipelines can define as many repositories "
"and promotions as necessary without concerns about storage costs."

"Promotions can also be done in JFrog platform with ``Release Bundles``. The "
"`Conan extensions repository <https://github.com/conan-io/conan-"
"extensions>`_ also contains one command to generate a release bundle (that "
"can be promoted using the Artifatory API)."
