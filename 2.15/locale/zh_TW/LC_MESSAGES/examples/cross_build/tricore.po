"TriCore is an embedded microcontroller architecture used in multiple domains "
"such as automotive. There are multiple compilers for TriCore, some of which "
"can be found `here <https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/tools/aurix-tools/"
"Compilers/>`__. There are also ``gcc`` implementations for TriCore; this is "
