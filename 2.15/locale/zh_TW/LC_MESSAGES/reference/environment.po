"These are very few environment variables that can be used to configure some "

"These environment variables are just a substitute of the interactive input "
"of the username or password when Conan CLI requests it. They do not perform "
"any kind of authentication unless the remote server throws an authentication "
"challenge. That means that for some remote servers configured to allow "
"anonymous usage, these will not be used, and the user will remain as an "
"unauthenticated user, unless a ``conan remote login`` or ``conan remote "
"auth`` is done first."

"the value of the command line arg if both are present. This can be useful to "
"temporarily change the log level in CI pipelines, in automation, etc., "
