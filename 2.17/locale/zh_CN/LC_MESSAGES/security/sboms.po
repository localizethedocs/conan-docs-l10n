"A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a document that lists all the "
"components, libraries, dependencies, and other elements that make up a "
"specific piece of software. Similar to a bill of materials in manufacturing, "
"which details the parts and materials used to build a product, an SBOM "
"provides transparency about what is contained \"inside\" an application or "
"software system."

"Conan allows you to generate SBOMs natively by using a resolved dependency "
"graph. This way, you can create the SBOM for your program at the same time "
"you build it."

"The CycloneDX tool is available in the ``conan.tools.sbom.cyclonedx`` "
