"There are some situations when recipes or source code are changed, but the "
"version of the package is not increased. For those situations, Conan uses "
"automatic ``revisions`` to be able to provide traceability and "
"reproducibility of those changes."

"Lockfiles are a common mechanism in package managers to be able to reproduce "
"the same dependency graph later in time, even when new versions or revisions "
"of dependencies are uploaded. Conan also provides lockfiles to be able to "
"guarantee this reproducibility."

"Finally, when different branches of a dependency graph ``requires`` "
"different versions of the same package, that is called a \"version "
"conflict\". The tutorial will also introduce these errors and how to address "
"them."
