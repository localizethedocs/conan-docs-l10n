"The ``conan report diff`` command gets the differences between two recipes, "
"also comparing their sources. This functionality allows you to compare "
"either two versions of the same recipe or two entirely different recipes. "
"Each recipe (old and new) can be identified in one of two ways: by providing "
"both the path to its ``conanfile.py`` and its reference, or by specifying "
"just the reference."
