"Hosting your own copy of the packages you need in your server could be done "
"by just downloading binaries from ConanCenter and then uploading them to "
"your own server. However, it is much better to fully own the complete supply "
"chain and create the binaries in your own CI systems. So the recommended "
"flow to use ConanCenter packages in production would be:"

"Create a script that first ``conan export`` all the packages in your list, "
"then ``conan create --build=missing`` them. Do not add ``user/channel`` to "
"these packages, it is way simpler to use them as ``zlib/1.2.13`` without "

"own proprietary packages, but not for open source ConanCenter packages."
