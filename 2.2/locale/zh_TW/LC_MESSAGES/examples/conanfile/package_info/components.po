"At the :ref:`section of the tutorial about the package_info() method "
"<tutorial_creating_define_package_info>`, we learned how to define "
"information in a package for consumers, such as library names or include and "
"library folders. In the tutorial, we created a package with only one library "
"that consumers linked to. However, in some cases, libraries provide their "
"functionalities separated into different *components*. These components can "
"be consumed independently, and in some cases, they may require other "
"components from the same library or others. For example, consider a library "
"like OpenSSL that provides *libcrypto* and *libssl*, where *libssl* depends "
"on *libcrypto*."

"Conan provides a way to abstract this information using the `components` "
"attribute of the `CppInfo` object to define the information for each "
"separate component of a Conan package. Consumers can also select specific "
"components to link against but not the rest of the package."
