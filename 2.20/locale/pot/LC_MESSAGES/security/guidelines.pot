"Avoid using tokens and passwords in URLs, they can easily be leaked in logs. "
"For example, if the ``source()`` method of recipes implement a ``git "
"clone``, do not use git credentials in the URL, but instead use ssh-keys "
"configured in the system. Same for downloading tarballs with ``tools.get()`` "
"and ``tools.download()``."

"In general, developers shouldn't have write permissions on servers, just "
"read permissions to download and install packages. Only the CI should have "
"write/upload permissions. As an exception, it might be possible to use some "
"\"playground\" repository that developers use to share packages for "
"debugging and testing purposes with other colleagues, but that "
"\"playground\" repository should be isolated from the normal testing and "
"production repositories."

"Use tokens with limited permissions in CI. If a job only needs read "
"permissions, use a token with read-permissions only. Use write credentials "

"In many production cases, it is very recommended to fully own the SW "
"lifecycle (SWLC) of the dependencies, including the third party "
"dependencies. For this reason, the :ref:`Using ConanCenter packages in "
"production environments <devops_consuming_conan_center>` section recommends "
"building your own binaries from source and storing those binaries in your "
"own private server, without downloading packages directly from ConanCenter. "
"The :ref:`local-recipes-index feature<devops_local_recipes_index>` was "
"designed to help in this process."
