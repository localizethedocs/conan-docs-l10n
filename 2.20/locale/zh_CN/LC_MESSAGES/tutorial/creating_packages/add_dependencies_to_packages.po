"In the :ref:`previous tutorial section<tutorial_creating_packages>`, we "
"created a Conan package for a \"Hello World\" C++ library. We used the :ref:"
"`conan.tools.scm.Git()<reference>` tool to retrieve the sources from a git "
"repository. So far, the package does not have any dependency on other Conan "
"packages. Let's explain how to add a dependency to our package in a very "
"similar way to how we did in the :ref:`consuming packages "
"section<consuming_packages_flexibility_of_conanfile_py>`. We will add some "
"fancy colour output to our \"Hello World\" library using the `fmt <https://"
"conan.io/center/fmt>`__ library."
