"Conan is a dependency and package manager for C and C++ languages. It is "
"`free and open-source <https://github.com/conan-io/conan>`_, works in all "
"platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.), and can be used "
"to develop for all targets including embedded, mobile (iOS, Android), and "
"bare metal. It also integrates with all build systems like CMake, Visual "
"Studio (MSBuild), Makefiles, SCons, etc., including proprietary ones."

msgid ""
"It is specifically designed and optimized for accelerating the development "
"and Continuous Integration of C and C++ projects. With full binary "
"management, it can create and reuse any number of different binaries (for "
"different configurations like architectures, compiler versions, etc.) for "
"any number of different versions of a package, using exactly the same "
"process in all platforms. As it is decentralized, it is easy to run your own "
"server to host your own packages and binaries privately, without needing to "
"share them. The free `JFrog Artifactory Community Edition (CE) <https://"

"Conan is a decentralized package manager with a client-server architecture. "

"At a high level, the servers are just storing packages. They do not build "

"The Conan client: this is a console/terminal command-line application, "

#: ../../../introduction.rst:44
msgid ""
"One of the most powerful features of Conan is that it can create and manage "
"pre-compiled binaries for any possible platform and configuration. By using "
"pre-compiled binaries and avoiding repeated builds from source, it saves "
"significant time for developers and Continuous Integration servers, while "
"also improving the reproducibility and traceability of artifacts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../introduction.rst:46
msgid ""
"A package is defined by a \"conanfile.py\". This is a file that defines the "
"package's dependencies, sources, how to build the binaries from sources, "
"etc. One package “conanfile.py” recipe can generate any arbitrary number of "
"binaries, one for each different platform and configuration: operating "
"system, architecture, compiler, build type, etc. These binaries can be "
"created and uploaded to a server with the same commands in all platforms, "
"having a single source of truth for all packages and not requiring a "
"different solution for every different operating system."

#: ../../../introduction.rst:53
msgid ""
"Installation of packages from servers is also very efficient. Only the "
"necessary binaries for the current platform and configuration are "
"downloaded, not all of them. If the compatible binary is not available, the "

"Conan works on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, ArchLinux, "

"Conan works with any build system too. There are built-in integrations to "
"support the most popular ones like CMake, Visual Studio (MSBuild), Autotools "
"and Makefiles, Meson, SCons, etc., but it is not a requirement to use any of "
"them. It is not even necessary that all packages use the same build system: "

"using different build systems. It is also possible to integrate with any "
"build system, including proprietary ones."

"Likewise, Conan can manage any compiler and any version. There are default "
