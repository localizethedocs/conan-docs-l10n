"The semantic versioning specification or `semver <https://semver.org/>`_, "
"specifies that packages should be versioned using always 3 dot-separated "
"digits like ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``, with very specific meanings for each "
"digit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:114
msgid ""
"Conan extends the semver specification to any number of digits, and also "
"allows to include lowercase letters in it. This was done because during 1.X "
"a lot of experience and feedback from users was gathered, and it became "
"evident than in C++ the versioning scheme is often more complex, and users "
"were demanding more flexibility, allowing versions like ``1.2.3.a.8`` if "
"necessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:119
msgid ""
"Conan versions non-digit identifiers follow the same rules as package names, "
"they can only contain lowercase letters. This is to avoid ``1.2.3-Beta`` to "
"be a different version than ``1.2.3-beta`` which can be problematic, even a "
"security risk."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:123
msgid ""
"The ordering of versions when necessary (for example to decide which is the "
"latest version in a version range) is done by comparing individually each "
"dot-separated entity in the version, from left to right. Digits will be "
"compared numerically, so 2 < 11, and entries containing letters will be "
"compared alphabetically (even if they also contain some numbers)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:128
msgid ""
"Similarly to the semver specification, Conan can manage **prereleases** and "
"**builds** in the form: ``VERSION-prerelease+build``. Conan will also order "
"pre-releases and builds according to the same rules, and each one of them "
"can also contain an arbitrary number of items, like ``1.2.3-"
"pre.1.2.1+build.45.a``. Note that the semver standard does not apply any "
"ordering to builds, but Conan does, with the same logic that is used to "
"order the main version and the pre-releases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:138
msgid ""
"Note that the ordering of pre-releases can be confusing at times. A pre-"
"release happens earlier in time than the release it is qualifying. So ``1.1-"
"alpha.1`` is older than ``1.1``, not newer."

msgid "Range expressions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:147
msgid ""
"Range expressions can have comparison operators for the lower and higher "
"bounds, separated with a space. Also, lower bounds and upper bounds in "
"isolation are permitted, though they are generally not recommended under "
"normal versioning schemes, specially the lower bound only. ``requires = "
"\"pkg/[>=1.0 <2.0]\"`` will include versions like 1.0, 1.2.3 and 1.9, but "
"will not include 0.3, 2.0 or 2.1 versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:153
msgid ""
"The tilde ``~`` operator can be used to define an \"approximately\" equal "
"version range. ``requires = \"pkg/[~1]\"`` will include versions 1.3 and "
"1.8.1, but will exclude versions like 0.8 or 2.0. Likewise ``requires = "
"\"pkg/[~2.5]\"`` will include 2.5.0 and 2.5.3, but exclude 2.1, 2.7, 2.8."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:157
msgid ""
"The caret ``^`` operator is very similar to the tilde, but allows "
"variability over the digit following the first non-zero digit. ``requires = "
"\"pkg/[^1.2]\"`` will include 1.2.1, 1.3 and 1.51, but will exclude 1.0, 2, "
"2.0. ``^1.2.0`` would act the same, while ``^0.1.2`` would include 0.1.2.1 "
"and 0.1.3, but exclude 0.1.1 and 0.2.0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:161
msgid ""
"It is also possible to apply multiple conditions with the OR operator, like "
"``requires = \"pkg/[>1 <2.0 || ^3.2]\"`` but this kind of complex "
"expressions is not recommended in practice and should only be used in very "
"extreme cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:164
msgid ""
"There is the possibility to use string-matching over the end of the string "
"to simplify some ranges that otherwise would require more complicated "
"conditions (this feature is experimental). Defining ``requires=pkg/[1.2.3."
"*]`` will match any version that starts exactly with ``1.2.3.``, and discard "
"others. For example it will match ``1.2.3.5`` and ``1.2.3.abc``, but it will "
"discard ``1.2.3`` (as it doesn't have the final dot)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:167
msgid ""
"Finally, note that pre-releases are not resolved by default. The way to "
"include them in the range is to explicitly enable them with either the "
"``include_prerelease`` option (``requires = \"pkg/[>1 <2, "
"include_prerelease]\"``), or via the ``core.version_ranges:"
"resolve_prereleases=True`` configuration, :ref:`which you can read more "
"about here<resolve_prereleases_summary>`. In this example, 1.0-pre.1 and "
"1.5.1-pre1 will be included, but 2.0-pre1 would be excluded."

#: ../../../tutorial/versioning/version_ranges.rst:175
msgid ""
"While it is possible to hardcode the ``include_prerelease`` in the "
"``requires`` version range, it is not recommended generally. Pre-releases "
"should be opt-in, and controlled by the user, who decides if they want to "
"use pre-releases. Also, note that the ``include_prerelease`` receives no "
"argument, hence it's not possible to deactivate prereleases with "
"``include_prerelease=False``."
