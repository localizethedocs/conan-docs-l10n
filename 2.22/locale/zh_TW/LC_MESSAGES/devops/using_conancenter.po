"ConanCenter is a fantastic resource that contains reference implementations "
"of recipes for over 1500 libraries and applications contributed by the "
"community. As such, it is a great knowledge base on how to create and build "
"Conan packages for open source dependencies."

"ConanCenter also builds and provides binary packages for a wide range of "
"configurations: multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), "
"compilers, compiler versions, and library variants (shared, static). On top "
"of this, for a lot of libraries community contributors ensure that recipes "
"are compatible for additional operating systems (Android, iOS, FreeBSD, QNX) "
"and CPU architectures. The recipes in Conan Center are the greatest example "
"of Conan’s universality promise."
msgstr ""
"ConanCenter 也為廣泛的組態建置並提供二進位包：多種作業系統（Windows、Linux、"
"macOS）、編譯器、編譯器版本以及程式庫變體（共享庫、靜態庫）。除此之外，針對許"
"多程式庫，社群貢獻者確保了配方能相容於額外的作業系統（Android、iOS、FreeBSD、"
"QNX）和 CPU 架構。ConanCenter 中的配方是 Conan 展現其通用性承諾的最佳範例。"

"Unlike other package managers or repositories, ConanCenter does not maintain "
"a fixed snapshot of versions. On the contrary, for a given library (e.g. "
"OpenCV), multiple versions are actively maintained at the same time. This "
"gives users greater control of which versions to use, rather than having to "
"remain fixed to an older version, or pushing them to always be on the latest "
"version."
msgstr ""
"與其他軟體包管理器或儲存庫不同，ConanCenter 並不維護固定的版本快照。相反地，"
"對於特定的程式庫（例如 OpenCV），會同時主動維護多個版本。這讓使用者能更靈活地"
"控制要使用的版本，而不必受限於舊版本，或被強迫必須始終使用最新版本。"

"In order to support this ecosystem, ConanCenter recipes are updated very "
"frequently. Recipes themselves may be updated to support a new platform, bug "
"fixes, or to require newer versions of their dependencies. On the other "
"hand, each user of ConanCenter may have a different combination of versions "
"in their requirements. This means that given the same input list of "
"requirements, Conan may resolve the graph differently at different points in "
"time - resolving to different recipe revisions, versions, or packages. This "
"is similar to the default behavior of package managers in other languages "
"(pip/PyPi, npm, cargo, etc). In production environments where "
"reproducibility is important, it is therefore discouraged to depend directly "
"on Conan Center in an unconstrained manner."

"As mentioned earlier - given a set of requirements, changes in ConanCenter "
"can cause the Conan dependency solver to resolve different graphs over time. "
"This does not only apply to the actual versions of libraries (e.g. "
"``opencv/4.5.0`` instead ``opencv/4.2.1``) - but also the recipes "
"themselves. That is, there may exist multiple revisions of the "
"``opencv/4.5.0`` recipe, which can have side effects for consumers. Changes "
"in recipes typically address a problem (bugfixes), target functionality (e."
"g. adding a conditional option, support for a new platform), or change "
"versions of dependencies."

"Consuming recipes and packages from the ConanCenter remote can be impacted "

"Some industries such as finance, robotics and embedded, have stronger "
"requirements around change management, open source licenses and "
"reproducibility. For example, changes in recipes could result in a new "
"version being resolved for a dependency, in a way that the license for that "
"version has changed and needs to be validated and audited by your "
"organization. In some industries like medical or automotive, you may be "
"required to ensure all your dependencies can be built from source in a "
"repeatable way, and thus using binaries provided by Conan Center may not be "
"advisable. In these instances, we recommend building your own binary "
"packages from source:"

"If the ``conancenter`` remote is used directly, your organization might "

"from ConanCenter. This can exceptionally be achieved with the "
"``recipes_only`` field :ref:`in the remote "
"configuration<reference_config_files_remotes_json>`, but it is highly likely "
"that you will also want to build the packages from source, and not depend on "

"It is very common for users of dependencies to require custom changes to "
"external libraries - typically to support specific platform configurations "
"not considered by either ConanCenter or the original library authors, "
"backport bug fixes, etc. Some of these changes may not be suitable to be "
"merged in ConanCenter, and it may not happen until this has been reviewed "
"and validated by ConanCenter maintainers. For this reason, if you need tight "
"control over the changes in recipes, it is highly recommended to host not "
"only a Conan remote, but your own fork of the conan-center-index recipe "
