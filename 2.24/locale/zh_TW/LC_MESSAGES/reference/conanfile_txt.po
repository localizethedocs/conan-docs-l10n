"The ``conanfile.txt`` file is a simplified version of ``conanfile.py``, "
"aimed at simple consumption of dependencies, but it cannot be used to create "
"a package. Also, it is not necessary to have a ``conanfile.txt`` for "
"consuming dependencies, a ``conanfile.py`` is perfectly suited for simple "
"consumption of dependencies."
