"There's a plugin `available in the JetBrains Marketplace <https://plugins."
"jetbrains.com/plugin/11956-conan>`_ that's compatible with CLion versions "
"higher than *2022.3*. With this plugin, you can browse Conan packages "
"available in `Conan Center <https://conan.io/center>`_, add them to your "
"project, and install them directly from the CLion IDE interface."

"This plugin utilizes `cmake-conan <https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan/"
"tree/develop2>`_, a `CMake dependency provider <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/"
"latest/guide/using-dependencies/index.html#dependency-providers>`_ for "
"Conan. It injects ``conan_provider.cmake`` using the "
"``CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES`` definition. This dependency provider "
"translates the CMake configuration to Conan. For instance, if you select a "
"*Debug* profile in CLion, Conan will install and use the packages for "
"*Debug*."

"Bear in mind that *cmake-conan* activates the Conan integration every time "
"CMake calls ``find_package()``. This means that no library will be installed "
"until the CMake configure step runs. At that point, Conan will attempt to "
"install the required libraries and build them if necessary."

#: ../../../integrations/clion.rst:28
msgid ""
"Also, note that dependency providers are a relatively new feature in CMake. "
"Therefore, you will need CMake version >= 3.24 and Conan >= 2.0.5."
