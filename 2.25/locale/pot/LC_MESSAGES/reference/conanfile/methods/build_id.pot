"The ``build_id()`` method allows you to **reuse a single build** to create "
"multiple binary packages in the Conan cache, saving time by avoiding "
"unnecessary rebuilds."

"It is primarily an optimization tool for situations where **building each "
"configuration separately isn't feasible**."

"There are a couple of scenarios where this could be useful, for example, "
"when a package build:"

"**Generates multiple configurations in a single build run**: Some build "
"scripts always produce both Debug and Release artifacts together, without a "

"**Produces one configuration but different sets of artifacts**: The build "

"In these scenarios, **reusing the same build folder avoids recompiling the "

"With this recipe, Debug and Release will each produce their own package IDs "

"**However, you still need to run one** :command:`conan create` **command per "
"configuration** (e.g., once for Debug, once for Release). Conan will check "
"if the build folder already exists (based on the shared build ID) and skip "
"the actual compilation if it's already been built, only executing "
"`package()` to create the corresponding package."
