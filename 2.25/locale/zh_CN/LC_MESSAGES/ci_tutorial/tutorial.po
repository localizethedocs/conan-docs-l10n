"The **products pipeline** takes care of building the main organization "

"The idea is that if some developer does changes to the ``ai`` package, "
"producing a new ``ai/1.1.0`` version, the packages pipeline will first build "
"this new version. But this new version might accidentally break or require "
"rebuilding some consumer packages. If our organization main **products** are "
"``game/1.0`` and ``mapviewer/1.0``, then the products pipeline can be "
"triggered, in this case it would rebuild ``engine/1.0`` and ``game/1.0`` as "

#: ../../../ci_tutorial/tutorial.rst:77
msgid ""
"``develop``: This repository is the main one that developers have configured "
"in their machines to be able to ``conan install`` dependencies and work. As "
"such it is expected to be quite stable, similar to a shared \"develop\" "
"branch in git, and the repository should contain pre-compiled binaries for "
"the organization's pre-defined platforms, so developers and CI don't need to "
"do ``--build=missing`` and build again and again from source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ci_tutorial/tutorial.rst:81
msgid ""
"``packages``: This repository will be used to temporarily upload the "
"packages built by the \"packages pipeline\", to not upload them directly to "
"the ``develop`` repo and avoid disruption until these packages are fully "
"validated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ci_tutorial/tutorial.rst:83
msgid ""
"``products``: This repository will be used to temporarily upload the "
"packages built by the \"products pipeline\", while building and testing that "
"new dependencies changes do not break the main \"products\"."
msgstr ""

"Promotions are the mechanism used to make packages available from one "
"pipeline to the other. Connecting the above packages and product pipelines "
"with the repositories, there will be 2 promotions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ci_tutorial/tutorial.rst:105
msgid ""
"When all the different binaries for the different configurations have been "
"built for a single package with the ``packages pipeline``, and uploaded to "
"the ``packages`` repository, the new version and changes to the package can "
"be considered \"correct\" and promoted (copied) to the ``products`` "
"repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ci_tutorial/tutorial.rst:108
msgid ""
"When the ``products pipeline`` has built from source all the necessary "
"packages that need a re-build because of the new package versions in the "

"\"products\" (such ``game/1.0`` and ``mapviewer/1.0``) are not broken, then "
