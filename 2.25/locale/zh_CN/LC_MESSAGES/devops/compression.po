"Conan compresses different artifacts before uploading them to the servers "
"for faster uploads and downloads, and lower storage needs. Specifically for "
"C and C++ packages that could contain hundreds of different files, for "
"example multiple header files, it is very inefficient to upload and store "
"them one by one."

"For this reason Conan creates some compressed artifacts like ``conan_export."
"tgz``, ``conan_sources.tgz`` and ``conan_package.tgz``, for the recipe extra "
"files, the exported sources and the final package binary respectively. These "
"are the files that are uploaded to the servers, together with the "
"``conanfile.py``, the ``conanmanifest.txt`` and the ``conaninfo.txt`` files."

#: ../../../devops/compression.rst:15
msgid ""
"The compression happens when a locally created artifact is being uploaded "
"with the ``conan upload`` command. If the recipe and package artifacts have "
"been downloaded from the server, the compressed artifacts are cached and it "
"is not necessary to compress them again. Furthermore, uploading them to a "
"server that contains those artifacts will skip the actual upload transfer "
"when the ``revisions`` match, or even avoid the transfer when uploading to a "
"repository without the revision, but the file already exists in the server "
"if the server has file de-duplication capabilities, like Artifactory."

"Conan has traditionally used only the built-in ``tgz`` format to compress "
"the artifacts, and allowed the ``core.gzip:compresslevel`` to select "
"different compression levels (a tradeoff between speed and compression "
"ratio)."

"From Conan 2.25 it is possible to choose between ``gz``, ``xz`` and ``zst`` "
"compression formats with the configuration: ``core.upload:"
"compression_format``. This configuration can be defined in the ``global."
"conf`` file. Recall that this file can also be distributed to all developers "
"and CI machines easily with ``conan config install/install-pkg``."

"The ``core:compresslevel`` allows to select the compression level for the "

"The ``zstd`` compression is using Python>=3.14 built-in features. It "
"requires then Python>=3.14, both for compressing and uploading, and for "
"consuming recipes and packages that were compressed with ``zstd``. Conan "
"will fail with an error message in both cases if Python<3.14."

"Previous Conan versions (Conan<2.25), only understand ``.tgz`` artifacts and "
"``gz`` compression, and will fail to process artifacts compressed with other "
"formats, Make sure that all your Conan clients have updated to >=2.25 before "
"using this feature."
