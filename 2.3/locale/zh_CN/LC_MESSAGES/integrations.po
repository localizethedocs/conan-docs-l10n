"Conan provides seamless integration with several platforms, build systems, "
"and IDEs. Conan brings off-the-shelf support for some of the most important "
"operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS. Some "
"of the most important build systems supported by Conan include CMake, "
"MSBuild, Meson, Autotools and Make. In addition to build systems, Conan also "
"provides integration with popular IDEs, such as Visual Studio and Xcode."

"Even though there is a plugin for the Visual Studio IDE, it is not "
"recommended to use it right now because it has not been updated for the 2.0 "
"version yet. However, we intend to resume working on this plugin and enhance "
"its functionality soon after Conan 2.0 is released."
