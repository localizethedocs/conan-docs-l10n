"Equivalent to the ``exports`` attribute, but in method form. This method "
"will be called at ``export`` time, which happens in the ``conan export`` and "
"``conan create`` commands, and it is intended to allow copying files from "
"the user folder to the Conan cache folders, thus making files becoming part "
"of the recipe. These sources will be uploaded to the servers together with "
"the recipe, but are typically not downloaded unless the package is being "
"built from source."

"There are 2 files that are always exported to the cache, without being "
"explicitly defined in the recipe: the ``conanfile.py`` recipe, and the "
"``conandata.yml`` file if it exists. The ``conandata.yml`` file is "
"automatically loaded whenever the ``conanfile.py`` is loaded, becoming the "
"``self.conan_data`` attribute, so it is a intrinsic part of the recipe, so "

"The recipe files must be configuration independent. Those files are common "
