"ConanCenter is a fantastic resource that contains reference implementations "
"of recipes for over 1500 libraries and applications contributed by the "
"community. As such, it is a great knowledge base on how to create and build "
"Conan packages for open source dependencies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devops/using_conancenter.rst:11
msgid ""
"ConanCenter also builds and provides binary packages for a wide range of "
"configurations: multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), "
"compilers, compiler versions, and library variants (shared, static). On top "
"of this, for a lot of libraries community contributors ensure that recipes "
"are compatible for additional operating systems (Android, iOS, FreeBSD, QNX) "
"and CPU architectures. The recipes in Conan Center are the greatest example "
"of Conan’s universality promise."

"Unlike other package managers or repositories, ConanCenter does not maintain "
"a fixed snapshot of versions. On the contrary, for a given library (e.g. "
"OpenCV), multiple versions are actively maintained at the same time. This "
"gives users greater control of which versions to use, rather than having to "
"remain fixed to an older version, or pushing them to always be on the latest "
"version."

"In order to support this ecosystem, ConanCenter recipes are updated very "
"frequently. Recipes themselves may be updated to support a new platform, bug "
"fixes, or to require newer versions of their dependencies. On the other "
"hand, each user of ConanCenter may have a different combination of versions "
"in their requirements. This means that given the same input list of "
"requirements, Conan may resolve the graph differently at different points in "
"time - resolving to different recipe revisions, versions, or packages. This "
"is similar to the default behavior of package managers in other languages "
"(pip/PyPi, npm, cargo, etc). In production environments where "
"reproducibility is important, it is therefore discouraged to depend directly "
"on Conan Center in an unconstrained manner."

"As mentioned earlier - given a set of requirements, changes in ConanCenter "
"can cause the Conan dependency solver to resolve different graphs over time. "
"This does not only apply to the actual versions of libraries (e.g. "
"``opencv/4.5.0`` instead ``opencv/4.2.1``) - but also the recipes "
"themselves. That is, there may exist multiple revisions of the "
"``opencv/4.5.0`` recipe, which can have side effects for consumers. Changes "
"in recipes typically address a problem (bugfixes), target functionality (e."
"g. adding a conditional option, support for a new platform), or change "
"versions of dependencies."

"In order to ensure repeatability, the use of lockfiles on the consumer side "

"Lockfiles ensure that Conan will resolve the same graph in a repeatable and "
"consistent manner - thus making sure the same versions are used across "
"multiple systems (CI, developers, etc)."

"Lockfiles are also used in other package managers like Python pip, Rust "

"Additionally, it is highly recommended to host your recipes and packages in "
"your own server (see below). Both of these approaches help you achieve "

"Consuming recipes and packages from the ConanCenter remote can be impacted "
"during periods of downtime (scheduled or otherwise). While every effort is "
"made to ensure that the ConanCenter is always available, and unscheduled "
"downtime is rare and treated with urgency - this can impact users that "
"depend on ConanCenter directly. Additionally, when building recipes from "
"source, this requires retrieving the source packages (typically zip or tar "
"files) from remote servers outside of the control of ConanCenter. "
"Occasionally, these too can suffer from unscheduled downtime."

"Some industries such as finance, robotics and embedded, have stronger "
"requirements around change management, open source licenses and "
"reproducibility. For example, changes in recipes could result in a new "
"version being resolved for a dependency, in a way that the license for that "
"version has changed and needs to be validated and audited by your "
"organization. In some industries like medical or automotive, you may be "
"required to ensure all your dependencies can be built from source in a "
"repeatable way, and thus using binaries provided by Conan Center may not be "
"advisable. In these instances, we recommend building your own binary "
"packages from source:"

"It is very common for users of dependencies to require custom changes to "
"external libraries - typically to support specific platform configurations "
"not considered by either ConanCenter or the original library authors, "
"backport bug fixes, etc. Some of these changes may not be suitable to be "
"merged in ConanCenter, and it may not happen until this has been reviewed "
"and validated by ConanCenter maintainers. For this reason, if you need tight "
"control over the changes in recipes, it is highly recommended to host not "
"only a Conan remote, but your own fork of the conan-center-index recipe "
"repository."
