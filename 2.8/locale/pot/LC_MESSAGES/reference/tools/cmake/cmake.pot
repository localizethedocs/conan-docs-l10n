"The ``CMake`` build helper is a wrapper around the command line invocation "
"of cmake. It will abstract the calls like ``cmake --build . --config "
"Release`` into Python method calls. It will also add the argument ``-"
"DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake`` (from the generator "
"``CMakeToolchain``) to the ``configure()`` call, as well as other possible "
"arguments like ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<config>``. The arguments that will be "
