"In the previous example, we built our CMake project and used Conan to "
"install and locate the **Zlib** library. We used the CMake already installed "
"in our system to build our compressor binary. However, what happens if you "
"want to build your project with a specific CMake version, different from the "
"one already installed system-wide? Conan can also help you install these "
"tools and use them to compile consumer projects or other Conan packages. In "
"this case, you can declare this dependency in Conan using a type of "
"requirement named ``tool_requires``. Let's see an example of how to add a "
"``tool_requires`` to our project and use a different CMake version to build "
"it."
