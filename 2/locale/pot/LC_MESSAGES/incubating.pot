"This section is dedicated to new features that are under development, "
"looking for user testing and feedback. They are generally behind a flag to "
"enable them to be explicitly opted-in at this testing stage. They require "
"the very latest Conan version (sometimes recommended running from the "
"``develop2`` source branch), and explicitly setting those flags."
