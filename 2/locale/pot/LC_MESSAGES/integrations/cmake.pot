"Conan provides different tools to integrate with CMake in a transparent way. "
"Using these tools, the consuming ``CMakeLists.txt`` file does not need to be "
"aware of Conan at all. The CMake tools also provide better IDE integration "
"via cmake-presets."

"``CMakeToolchain``: generates all the information needed for CMake to build "
"the packages according to the information passed to Conan about things like "
"the operating system, the compiler to use, architecture, etc. in a "
"``conan_toolchain.cmake`` toolchain file. It will also generate `cmake-"
"presets` files for easy integration with some IDEs that support this CMake "
"feature off-the-shelf."

"``CMake`` build helper is the tool used by Conan ``conanfile.py`` recipes to "

"This flow is important, the ``conan install`` command generates CMake "
"presets and ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` toolchain files that helps locating "
"the dependencies, besides trying to align as best as possible with the "

"In extraordinary and exceptional scenarios, it might be desired for the "
"``CMake`` execution to call ``conan install`` to simplify the flow, for "

"For this purpose, the  `cmake-conan integration <https://github.com/conan-io/"

"intercept the first ``find_package()`` and do a call to ``conan install`` to "
"fetch the dependencies at that point."

"This ``cmake-conan`` project stability is not guaranteed, and it has some "
