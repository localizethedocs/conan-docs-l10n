"The root cause is that resolving the joint compatibility for all the "
"possible constraints that version-ranges define in a graph is a known NP-"
"hard problem, known as SAT-solver. Evaluating each hypothesis in this NP-"
"hard problem in Conan is very expensive, because it usually requires to look "
"for a version/revision in all remotes defined, then download such version/"
"revision compressed files, unzip them, load and Python-parse and evaluate "
"them and finally to do all the graph computation processing, which involves "
"a full propagation down the already expanded graph to propagate the C/C++ "
"requirement traits that can produce the conflicts. This would make the "
"problem intractable in practice, that would require to wait for many hours "
"to finish."

#: ../../../knowledge/faq.rst:206
msgid ""
"So instead of doing that, Conan uses a \"greedy\" algorithm that does not "
"require backtracking, but still will try to reconcile version-ranges with "
"fixed versions when possible. The most important point to know about this is "
"that Conan implements a \"depth-first\" graph expansion, evaluating the "
"``requires`` in the order they are declared. Knowing this can help to solve "
"this conflict. In the case above the error happens because ``libb/1.0`` is "
"expanded first, it finds a requirement of ``liba/[>=1.0 <2]``, and as no "
"other constraint to ``liba`` has been found before, it freely resolves to "
"the latest ``liba/1.1``. When later ``libc/1.0`` is expanded, it finds a "
"requirement to ``liba/1.0``, but it is already too late, as it will conflict "
"with the previous ``liba/1.1``. Going back in the previous hypothesis is the "
"\"backtracking\" part that converts the problem in NP-hard, so the algorithm "
"stops there and raises the conflict."
