"Hosting your own copy of the packages you need in your server could be done "
"by just downloading binaries from ConanCenter and then uploading them to "
"your own server. However, it is much better to fully own the complete supply "
"chain and create the binaries in your own CI systems. So the recommended "
"flow to use ConanCenter packages in production would be:"

"Do not add ``user/channel`` to packages created from ConanCenter forks, it "
"is way simpler to create and use them as ``zlib/1.2.13`` without user-"
"channel. The ``user/channel`` part would be mostly recommended for your own "
"proprietary packages, but not for open source ConanCenter packages. It adds "
"more divergence from the upstream and consequently more maintenance with "
"little added value."

"Do not mix packages and recipes created from your fork of ``conan-center-"
"index`` Github repo with the ones from ConanCenter central server. Once you "
"create some binaries for third parties from your fork, it is strongly "
"recommended to fully disconnect from ConanCenter (you can remove the "
"``remote``, and you can add the ``remotes.json`` file with your own remotes "
"to the configuration you can distribute and install with ``conan config "
"install/install-pkg``), and create all your third-party packages from your "
"fork."
