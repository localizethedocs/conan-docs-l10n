"The ``CppInfo`` class represents the basic C++ usage information of a given "
"package, like the ``includedirs``, ``libdirs``, library names, etc. It is "
"the information that the consumers of the package need in order to be able "
"to find the headers and link correctly with the libraries."

"The ``self.cpp_info`` object in the ``package_info()`` is a ``CppInfo`` "
"object, so in most cases it will not be necessary to explicitly instantiate "
"it, and using it as explained in :ref:`the "
"package_info()<reference_conanfile_methods_package_info>` section would be "
"enough."
