"The **packages pipeline** will build, create and upload the package binaries "
"for the different configurations and platforms, when some developer is "
"submitting some changes to one of the organization repositories source code. "
"For example if a developer is doing some changes to the ``ai`` package, "
"improving some of the library functionality, and bumping the version to "
"``ai/1.1.0``. If the organization needs to support both Windows and Linux "
"platforms, then the package pipeline will build the new ``ai/1.1.0`` both "
"for Windows and Linux, before considering the changes are valid. If some of "
"the configurations fail to build under a specific platform, it is common to "
"consider the changes invalid and stop the processing of those changes, until "
"the code is fixed."

"For the ``package pipeline`` we will start with a simple source code change "
"in the ``ai`` recipe, simulating some improvements in the ``ai`` package, "
"providing some better algorithms for our game."

"Finally, let's bump the version. As we did some changes to the package "
"public headers, it would be adviced to bump the ``minor`` version, so let`s "
"edit the ``ai/conanfile.py`` file and define ``version = \"1.1.0\"`` there "
"(instead of the previous ``1.0``). Note that if we did some breaking changes "
"to the ``ai`` public API, the recommendation would be to change the major "
"instead and create a new ``2.0`` version."

"The **packages pipeline** will take care of building the different packages "
"binaries for the new ``ai/1.1.0`` and upload them to the ``packages`` binary "
"repository to avoid disrupting or causing potential issues to other "

"to the ``products`` binary repository, and stop otherwise."
