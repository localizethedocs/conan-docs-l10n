"In the previous example, we built both ``Debug`` and ``Release`` package "
"binaries for ``ai/1.1.0``. In real world scenarios the binaries to build "
"would be different platforms (Windows, Linux, embedded), different "
"architectures, and very often it will not be possible to build them in the "
"same machine, requiring different computers."

"The previous example had an important assumption: the dependencies of "
"``ai/1.1.0`` do not change at all during the building process. In many "
"scenarios, this assumption will not hold, for example if there are any other "
"concurrent CI jobs, and one succesfull job publishes a new ``mathlib/1.1`` "
"version in the ``develop`` repo."

"Then it is possible that one build of ``ai/1.1.0``, for example, the one "
"running in the Linux servers starts earlier and uses the previous "
"``mathlib/1.0`` version as dependency, while the Windows servers start a bit "
"later, and then their build will use the recent ``mathlib/1.1`` version as "
"dependency. This is a very undesirable situation, having binaries for the "
"same ``ai/1.1.0`` version using different dependencies versions. This can "
"lead in later graph resolution problems, or even worse, get to the release "
"with different behavior for different platforms."

"The way to avoid this discrepancy in dependencies is to force the usage of "
