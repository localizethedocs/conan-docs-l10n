"The main idea is to illustrate the need to rebuild some packages because "
"there is a new ``ai/1.1.0`` version that can be integrated by our main "
"products. This new ``ai`` version is in the ``products`` repository, as it "

"Recall that the ``products`` repo has higher priority than the ``develop`` "

"repositories can be done with ``--update``, but that would be slower and "
"with the right repository ordering, it is not necessary)."
