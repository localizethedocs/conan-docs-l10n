"Toolchains are the new, experimental way to integrate with build systems in "
"Conan. Recipes can define a ``generate()`` method that will return an object "
"which can generate files from the current configuration that can be used by "
"the build systems. Conan *generators* provide information about "
"dependencies, while toolchains provide a \"translation\" from the Conan "
"settings and options, and the recipe defined configuration to something that "
"the build system can understand. A recipe that does not have dependencies "
"does not need a generator, but can still use a toolchain."
