"With the ``conan cache save`` and ``conan cache restore`` commands, it is "
"possible to create a .tgz from one or several packages from a Conan cache "
"and later restore those packages into another Conan cache. There are some "
"scenarios this can be useful:"

"In Continuous Integration, specially if doing distributed builds, it might "
"be very convenient to be able to move temporary packages recently built. "
"Most CI systems have the capability of transferring files between jobs for "
"this purpose. The Conan cache is not concurrent, sometimes for paralllel "
"jobs different caches have to be used."
