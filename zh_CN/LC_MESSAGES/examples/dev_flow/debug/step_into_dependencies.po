"Recipes and packages from ConanCenter do not package always all the debug "
"artifacts necessary to debug. For example in Windows, the ``*.pdb`` files "
"are not packaged, because they are very heavy, and in practice barely used. "
"It is possible to have your own packages to package the PDB files if you "
"want, but that still won't solve the next point."

"Debug artifacts are often not relocatable, that means that such artifacts "
"can only be used in the location they were built from sources. But packages "
"that are uploaded to a server and downloaded to a different machine can put "
"those artifacts in a different folder. Then, the debug artifacts might not "
"correctly locate the source code, the symbols, etc."
