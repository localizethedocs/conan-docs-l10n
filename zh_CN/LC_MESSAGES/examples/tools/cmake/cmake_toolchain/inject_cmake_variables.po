"In the general case, Conan package recipes provide the necessary "
"abstractions via settings, confs, and options to control different aspects "
"of the build. Many recipes define ``options`` to activate or deactivate "
"features, optional dependencies, or binary characteristics. Configurations "
"like ``tools.build:cxxflags`` can be used to inject arbitrary C++ compile "
"flags."
