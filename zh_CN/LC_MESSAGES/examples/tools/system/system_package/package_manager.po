"Conan can manage system packages, allowing you to install platform-specific "
"dependencies easily. This is useful when you need to install platform-"
"specific system packages. For example, you may need to install a package "
"that provides a specific driver or graphics library that only works on a "
"specific platform."

"In this example, we are going to explore the steps needed to create a "
"wrapper package around a system library and what is needed to consume it in "
"a Conan package. Note that the package will not contain the binary "
"artifacts, it will just manage to check/install them calling "
"``system_requirements()`` and the respective system package managers (e.g "
"Apt, Yum). In this example, we are going to create a Conan package to wrap "
"the system `ncurses <https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/>`_ requirement "
"and then show how to use this requirement in an application."
