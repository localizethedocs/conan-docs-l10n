"This are the **default** settings and values. They are a common syntax and "
"notation for having package binary IDs that are common to all developers. "
"They are also used for validation, for example if you write in a profile "
"``[settings]`` something like ``os=Windos`` (note the typo), then it will "
"raise an error, telling you it is not a recognized ``os`` and offering a "
"list of available ``os``. Also, note how the sub-settings are different for "
"different platforms, for example the standard C++ library (``compiler."
"libcxx``) exists for the ``gcc`` compiler, but not for ``Visual Studio`` "
"compiler. And in the same way, ``Visual Studio`` has a ``runtime`` sub-"
"setting that is missing in ``gcc``. Trying to incorrectly use or define "
"these sub-settings in the wrong compiler will also raise an error."

"For example, it is possible that you are managing binaries for older Linux "

"problem is that the binaries compiled for modern distributions will not work "
"(will not be binary compatible, or ABI incompatible) in those older "
"distributions, mainly because of different versions of glibc. We would need "
"a way to model the differences of the binaries for those platforms. Check "
