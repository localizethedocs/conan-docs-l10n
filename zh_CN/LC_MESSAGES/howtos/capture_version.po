"In this example, the package created with :command:`conan create` will be "

"returns ``None`` if it is not able to get the Git data. This is necessary "
"when the recipe is already in the Conan cache, and the Git repository may "
"not be there,. A value of ``None`` makes Conan get the version from the "
