"Conan can be installed in many Operating Systems. It has been extensively "
"used and tested in Windows, Linux (different distros), OSX, and is also "
"actively used in FreeBSD and Solaris SunOS. There are also several "

"The preferred and **strongly recommended way to install Conan** is from "

"There are other available installers for different systems, which might come "

"first. Please note that some of **these installers might have some "

"To install Conan using ``pip``, you need a python 2.7 or 3.X distribution "
"installed in your machine. Modern python distros come with pip pre-"
"installed. However, if necessary you can install pip by following the "
"instructions in `pip docs`_."

"Python 2 will by deprecated soon by the Python maintainers. It is strongly "
"recommended to use Python 3 for conan, especially if need to manage non-"
"ascii filenames or file contents. Conan still supports Python 2, but some of "
"the dependencies have started to be Python 3 only too. The roadmap for "
"deprecating Python 2 support in Conan will be defined soon."
