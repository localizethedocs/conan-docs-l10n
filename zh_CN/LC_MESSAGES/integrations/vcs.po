"Conan uses plain text files for the recipes and configuration files and they "
"can be managed nicely with any version control system. Also, with the :ref:"
"`scm<scm_feature>` feature, your recipe can capture automatically the "
"``commit/revision`` of the source code of your library so the recipe will "
"clone the correct sources automatically."
