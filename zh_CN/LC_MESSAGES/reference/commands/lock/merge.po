"This ``conan lock merge`` command can be useful to consolidate in a single "
"lockfile when for some reasons there are several lockfiles that have "
"diverged. A use case would be to create a multi-configuration lockfile that "
"contains all necessary locked versions for all OSs (Linux, Windows, etc), "
"even if there are conditional dependencies in the graph for the different "
"OSs. At some point when testing a new dependency version, for example, "
"``pkg/3.4`` new version, when previously ``pkg/3.3`` was already in the "
"graph, we might want to have such a new lockfile cleaning the previous "
"``pkg/3.3``. If we apply the ``--lockfile-clean`` argument that will remove "
"the non-used versions in the lockfile, but that will also remove the OS-"
"dependant dependencies. So something like this could be done: lets say that "
"we have this lockfile (simplified, removed revisions for simplicity) as the "
"result of testing a new ``pkgb/0.2`` version for our main product "
"``app1/0.1``:"
