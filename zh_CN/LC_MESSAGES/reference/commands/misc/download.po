"Downloads recipe and binaries to the local cache, without using settings. It "
"works specifying the recipe reference and package ID to be installed. Not "
"transitive, requirements of the specified reference will NOT be retrieved. "
"Useful together with 'conan copy' to automate the promotion of packages to a "
"different user/channel. Only if a reference is specified, it will download "
"all packages from the specified remote. If no remote is specified, it will "
"use the default remote."
