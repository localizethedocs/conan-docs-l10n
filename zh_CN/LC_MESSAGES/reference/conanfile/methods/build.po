"The ``build()`` method should be as simple as possible, just wrapping the "
"command line invocations that a developer would do in the simplest possible "
"way. The ``generate()`` method is the one responsible for preparing the "
"build, creating toolchain files, CMake presets, or any other files which are "
"necessary so developers could easily call the build system by hand. This "
"allows for much better integrations with IDEs and improves the developer "
"experience. The result is that in practice the ``build()`` method should be "
"relatively simple."

"The ``build()`` method runs once per unique configuration, so if there are "
"some source operations like applying patches that are done conditionally to "
"different configurations, they could be also applied in the ``build()`` "
"method, before the actual build. It is important to note that in this case "
"the :ref:`no_copy_source <conan_conanfile_properties_no_copy_source>` "
"attribute cannot be set to ``True``."

"The ``build()`` method is the right place to build and run unit tests, "
"before packaging, and raising errors if those tests fail, interrupting the "
"process, and not even packaging the final binaries. The built-in helpers "
"will skip the unit tests if the ``tools.build:skip_test`` configuration is "
"defined. For custom integrations, it is expected that the method checks this "
"``conf`` value in order to skip building and running tests, which can be "
"useful for some CI scenarios."
