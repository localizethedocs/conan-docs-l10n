"The ``compatibility()`` method implements the same binary compatibility "
"mechanism than the :ref:`compatibility "
"plugin<reference_extensions_binary_compatibility>`, but at the recipe level. "
"In general, the global compatibility plugin should be good for most cases, "
"and only require the recipe method for exceptional cases."

"This method can be used in a *conanfile.py* to define packages that are "
"compatible between each other. If there are no binaries available for the "
"requested settings and options, this mechanism will retrieve the compatible "
"package's binaries if they exist. This method should return a list of "
"compatible configurations."
