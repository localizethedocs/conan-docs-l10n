"``Environment`` is a generic class that helps defining modifications to the "
"environment variables. This class is used by other tools like the :ref:"
"`conan.tools.gnu<conan_tools_gnu>` autotools helpers and the :ref:"
"`VirtualBuildEnv<conan_tools_env_virtualbuildenv>` and :ref:"
"`VirtualRunEnv<conan_tools_env_virtualrunenv>` generator. It is important to "
"highlight that this is a generic class, to be able to use it, a "
"specialization for the current context (shell script, bat file, path "
"separators, etc), a ``EnvVars`` object needs to be obtained from it."
