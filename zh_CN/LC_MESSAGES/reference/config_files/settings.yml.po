"The ``settings`` are predefined, so only a few, like \"os\" or \"compiler\", "
"are possible. They are defined in your ``~/.conan/settings.yml`` file. Also, "
"the possible values they can take are restricted in the same file. This is "
"done to ensure matching naming and spelling between users, and settings that "
"commonly make sense to most users. Anyway, you can add/remove/modify those "
"settings and their possible values in the ``settings.yml`` file, according "
"to your needs, just be sure to share changes with colleagues or consumers of "
"your packages."
