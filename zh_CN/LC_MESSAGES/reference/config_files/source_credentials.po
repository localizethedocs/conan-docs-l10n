"For this purpose the ``source_credentials.json`` file can be provided in the "
"Conan cache. This file has the following format, in which every "
"``credentials`` entry should have a ``url`` that defines the URL that should "
"match the recipe one. If the recipe URL starts with the given one in the "
"credentials files, then the credentials will be injected. If the file "
"provides multiple credentials for multiple URLs, they will be evaluated in "
"order until the first match happens. If no match is found, no credentials "
"will be injected. A custom :ref:`auth plugin "
"<reference_extensions_authorization_plugin>` can also be used to retrieve "
"credentials directly from your own secrets manager."

"It has to be noted that the ``source_credentials`` applies only to files "

"the ``credentials.json`` file should be used instead, see :ref:"
