"A Remote object can be constructed to be passed as an argument to RemotesAPI "
"methods. When possible, it is better to use Remote objects returned by the "
"API, but for the ``RemotesAPI.add()`` method, for which a new constructed "
"object is necessary. It is recommended to use named arguments like "
"``Remote(..., verify_ssl=False)`` in the constructor. :param name: The name "
"of the remote. :param url: The URL of the remote repository (or local folder "
"for \"local-recipes-index\"). :param verify_ssl: Enable SSL Certificate "
"validation. :param disabled: Disable the remote repository. :param "
"allowed_packages: List of patterns of allowed packages from this remote :"
"param remote_type: Type of the remote repository, use \"local-recipes-"
"index\" or ``None`` :param recipes_only: If True, binaries form this remote "
"will be ignored and never used"

"If external operations might have modified the remote since it was "
"instantiated, this method can be called to invalidate the cache. Note that "
"this is done automatically when the remote is used in any operation by "
"Conan, such as uploading packages, so this method is not usually needed when "
"only interacting with the Conan API"
