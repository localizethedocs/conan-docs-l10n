"To set up a local recipes index repository to share your own recipes, you "
"need to organize your recipes in a folder structure that mimics that of "
"`conan-center-index`. To get started, you can use the `local_recipes_index` "
"template for the `conan new` command. For demonstration purposes, let's "
"create a `local-recipes-index` repository for a hypothetical `hello` "
"library, with a license incompatible with Conan Center, using the "
"`local_recipes_index` template for the :command:`conan new` command:"
