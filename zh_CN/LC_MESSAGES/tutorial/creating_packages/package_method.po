"This is the simplest choice when you have already defined in your "

"place and maybe do some post-processing of those artifacts. This will work "
"without changes in your `CMakeLists.txt` because Conan will set the "
"``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` CMake variable to point to the recipe's :ref:"
"`package_folder <conan_conanfile_properties_package_folder>` attribute. "
"Then, just calling `install()` in the `CMakeLists.txt` over the created "
