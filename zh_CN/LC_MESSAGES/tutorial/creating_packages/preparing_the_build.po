"In the :ref:`previous tutorial "
"section<creating_packages_add_dependencies_to_packages>`, we added the `fmt "
"<https://conan.io/center/fmt>`__ requirement to our Conan package to provide "
"colour output to our \"Hello World\" C++ library. In this section, we focus "
"on the ``generate()`` method of the recipe. The aim of this method is to "
"generate all the information that could be needed while running the build "
"step. That means things like:"

"We explain how to use this method for a simple example based on the previous "

"its value we either require the `fmt` library or not. We use the "
"``generate()`` method to modify the toolchain so that it passes a variable "
"to CMake so that we can conditionally add that library and use `fmt` or not "
"in the source code."
