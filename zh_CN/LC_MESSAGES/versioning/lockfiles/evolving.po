"As described before, lockfiles are immutable, they cannot change the "

"some data in a lockfile, it will error. This doesn't mean that operations on "
"lockfiles cannot be done, as it is possible to create a new lockfile from an "
"existing one. We have already done this, obtaining a full lockfile for a "
"specific configuration from an initial \"base\" lockfile."
