"In the previous package we implemented a ``source()`` method that fetched "
"the source code from github. An alternative approach would be embedding the "
"source code into the package recipe, so it is self-contained and it doesn't "
"require to fetch code from external origins when it is necessary to build "
"from sources."

"This could be an appropriate approach if we want the package recipe to live "
