"When working in big projects with several functionalities interconnected it "
"is recommended to avoid the one-and-only huge project approach in favor of "
"several libraries, each one specialized in a set of common tasks, even "
"maintained by dedicated teams. This approach helps to isolate and reusing "
"code helps with compiling times and reduces the likelihood of including "
"files that not correspond to the API of the required library."

"Nevertheless, in some case, it is useful to work in several libraries at the "
"same time and see how the changes in one of them are propagated to the "
"others. With the normal flow, for every source change, it is necessary to do "
"``conan create`` or ``conan export-pkg`` to put the package in the cache and "
"make it available to consumers."
