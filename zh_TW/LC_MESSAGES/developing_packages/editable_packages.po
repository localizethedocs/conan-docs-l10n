"When working in big projects with several functionalities interconnected it "
"is recommended to avoid the one-and-only huge project approach in favor of "
"several libraries, each one specialized in a set of common tasks, even "
"maintained by dedicated teams. This approach helps to isolate and reusing "
"code helps with compiling times and reduces the likelihood of including "
"files that not correspond to the API of the required library."

"Nevertheless, in some case, it is useful to work in several libraries at the "

"execute the commands :command:`conan source`, :command:`conan install`, :"
"command:`conan build` and :command:`conan package`, but in order to get the "
"changes ready for a consumer library, it is needed the :command:`conan "
