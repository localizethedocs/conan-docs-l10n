"A Conan package is typically composed by several C and C++ artifacts, "

"There are several important reasons to store and track these files like "
"regulations, compliance, security, reproducibility and traceability. The "
"problem with these files is that they can be large/heavy, if we store them "
"inside the package (just copying the artifacts in the ``package()`` method), "
"this will make the packages much larger, and it will affect the speed of "
"downloading, unzipping and using packages in general. And this typically "
"happens a lot of times, both in developer machines but also in CI, and it "
"can have an impact on the developer experience and infrastructure costs. "
"Furthermore, packages are immutable, that is, once a package has been "
"created, it shouldn't be modified. This might be a problem if we want to add "
"extra metadata files after the package has been created, or even after the "
"package has been uploaded."
