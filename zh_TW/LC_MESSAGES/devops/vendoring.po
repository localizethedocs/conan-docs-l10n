"From Conan 2.4 it is possible to create and use Conan packages that "
"completely vendor their dependencies, that is, they completely hide and "
"isolate their dependencies from their consumers. This can be useful in some "
"different cases:"

"When sharing Conan packages with other organizations which vendor (copy, "
"embed or link) the dependencies, so it is not necessary for the consumers of "
"their packages to have access to those dependencies and the intention is "
"that they always use the shared precompiled binaries."

"When we have this recipe, we can create its binaries with a normal ``conan "
"create .``. But when we use this package as a requirement for other "
"packages, its dependencies will be fully invisible. The graph will not even "

"The dependencies of a vendoring package always form a fully private and "

msgid ""
"It is the responsibility of the vendoring package and its users to guarantee "
"that vendored dependencies do not collide. If a vendoring package vendors "
"for example ``libssl.a`` as a static library doing a regular copy of it in "
"its package, and there is another package in the graph that also provides "
"``libssl``, there will be a conflict that Conan cannot detect as ``libssl."
"a`` is vendored as an internal implementation detail of the package, but not "
"explicitly modeled. Mechanisms like ``provides`` can be used for this "
"purpose, but it is the responsibility of the recipe authors to take it into "
"account."

msgid ""
"The ``package_id`` of a package that defines ``vendor=True`` is fully "
"independent of its dependencies. The dependencies versions will never affect "
"the ``package_id`` of the vendoring package, so it is important to note that "
"the version of the vendoring package represents a full private dependency "
"graph."

"The regular ``default_options`` or options values definitions from consumer "

"To allow the expansion of the private dependency the ``tools.graph:"
"vendor=build`` configuration can be activated. If that is the case, the "
"private dependency graph of the package will be computed and expanded and "
"the package will be allowed to build."
