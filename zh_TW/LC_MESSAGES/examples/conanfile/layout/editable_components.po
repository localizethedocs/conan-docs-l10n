"It is possible to define components in the ``layout()`` method, to support "
"the case of ``editable`` packages. That is, if we want to put a package in "
"``editable`` mode, and that package defines ``components``, it is necessary "
"to define the components layout correctly in the ``layout()`` method. Let's "
"see it in a real example."
