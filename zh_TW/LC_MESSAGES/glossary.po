"A build helper is a Python script that translates Conan settings to the "

"build helper sets the CMake flag for the generator from Conan settings like "
"the compiler, operating system, and architecture. Conan provides integration "
"for several build tools such as :ref:`CMake<cmake_reference>`, :ref:"
"`Autotools<autotools_reference>`, :ref:`MSBuild<msbuild>` or :ref:"
"`Meson<meson_build_reference>`. You can also `integrate your preferred build "
