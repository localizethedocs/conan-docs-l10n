"The ``Intel`` compiler is a particular case, as it uses ``Visual Studio`` "
"compiler in Windows environments and ``gcc`` in Linux environments. If you "
"are wondering how to manage the compatibility between the packages generated "
"with ``intel`` and the generated with the pure base compiler (``gcc`` or "
"``Visual Studio``) check the :ref:`Compatible Packages<compatible_packages>` "
"and :ref:`Compatible Compilers<compatible_compilers>` sections."
