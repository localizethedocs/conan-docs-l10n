"Conan is universal and portable. It works in all operating systems including "
"Windows, Linux, OSX, FreeBSD, Solaris, and others, and it can target any "
"platform, including desktop, server, and cross-building for embedded and "
"bare metal devices. It integrates with other tools like Docker, MinGW, WSL, "
"and with all build systems such as CMake, MSBuild, Makefiles, Meson, SCons. "
"It can even integrate with any proprietary build systems."

"Conan is completely `free and open source <https://github.com/conan-io/"
"conan>`_ and fully decentralized. It has native integration with JFrog "
"Artifactory, including the free Artifactory Community Edition for Conan, "
"enabling developers to host their own private packages on their own server. "
"The `ConanCenter <https://conan.io/center>`_ central repository contains "
"hundreds of popular open source libraries packages, with many pre-compiled "
"binaries for mainstream compiler versions."

"Conan can manage any number of different binaries for different build "
"configurations, including different architectures, compilers, compiler "
"versions, runtimes, C++ standard library, etc. When binaries are not "
"available for one configuration, they can be built from sources on-demand. "
"Conan can create, upload and download binaries with the same commands and "
"flows on every platform, saving lots of time in development and continuous "
"integration. The binary compatibility can even be configured and customized "
"on a per-package basis."

"Conan has  a very large and active community, especially in `Github "
"repositories <https://github.com/conan-io/conan>`_ and `Slack #conan channel "
"<https://cppalliance.org/slack/>`_. This community also creates and "
"maintains packages in ConanCenter. Conan is used in production by thousands "
"of companies, and consequently, it has a commitment to stability, with no "
"breaking changes across all Conan 1.X versions."
