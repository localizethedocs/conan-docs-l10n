"working with multi-configuration projects like ``Visual Studio`` with both "

"Add the ``CONFIG`` option to ``find_package`` so that *module mode* is "
"explicitly skipped by CMake. This helps to solve issues when there is for "
"example a ``FindXXXX.cmake`` file in CMake's default modules directory that "
"could be loaded instead of the ``XXXXConfig.cmake`` generated by Conan."
