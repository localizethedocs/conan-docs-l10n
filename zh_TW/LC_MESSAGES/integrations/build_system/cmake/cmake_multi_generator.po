"``cmake_multi`` generator is intended for CMake multi-configuration "
"environments, like Visual Studio and Xcode IDEs that do not configure for a "
"specific ``build_type``, like Debug or Release, but rather can be used for "
"both and switch among Debug and Release configurations with a combo box or "
"similar control. The project configuration for cmake is different, in multi-"
"configuration environments, the flow would be:"
