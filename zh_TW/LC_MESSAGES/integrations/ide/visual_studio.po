"You can install it into your IDE using the **Extensions manager** and start "
"using it right away. This extension will look for a *conanfile.py* (or "
"*conanfile.txt*) and retrieve the requirements declared in it that match "
"your build configuration (it will build them from sources if no binaries are "
"available)."

"In version ``1.0`` of the extension, the algorithm to look for the "
"*conanfile.py* (preferred) or *conanfile.txt* is very na√Øve: It will start "
"looking for those files in the directory where the **Visual Studio project "
"file** is located and then it will walk recursively into parent directories "
"to look for them."
