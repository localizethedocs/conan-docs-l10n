"`Continuous Integration for Large Scale C/C++ Projects With Conan2` by Diego "
"Rodriguez-Losada"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../knowledge/videos.rst:20
msgid ""
"There are two main paradigms to develop large scale C, C++ projects: using "
"mono-repos and package-based development, both have different pros and cons. "
"Using package managers such as Conan allows easy retrieval of dependencies, "
"including binaries, avoiding continuous and expensive rebuilds from source. "
"While this works easily for third party dependencies, when dependencies are "
"very stable, quick evolution in a large dependency graph when there are "
"different developers working concurrently in different packages, can be more "
"challenging."

"With Conan 2's new tools it is possible to implement an efficient Continuous "
"Integration process for large scale projects, computing what packages need "
"to be built, and in what specific order and parallelism."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../knowledge/videos.rst:25
msgid ""
"The concept of \"products pipeline\" will be introduced as an scalable "
"approach that allows to focus on the business value while allowing "
"efficiency. The dependency graph build order for every different product can "
"be computed, for every different configuration (platform, compiler, "
"build_type, etc). This is done efficiently, taking into account the "
"versioning scheme and the package types (header-only, static library, shared "
"library, application) with a explicit novel model of the dependencies effect "
"in the packages binaries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../knowledge/videos.rst:27
msgid ""
"Then all the different computed graph \"build-orders\" can be merged into a "
"single one to avoid duplicated builds. The final graph merged \"build-"
"order\" can be distributed efficiently to different build agents, as it also "
"specifies which package builds can be done in parallel. For projects with "
"concurrent changes, using lockfiles is very important in this stage to "
"guarantee consistency and reproducibility of the dependencies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../knowledge/videos.rst:29
msgid ""
"Finally, the concept of stages in the CI process using multiple server "
"repositories and copying of packages across those repositories will be "
"presented. This process is known as package promotions and is a known best "
"practice in DevOps for other technologies, and is critical to avoid "
"disruptions to developers and production systems that the CI builds could "
"introduce."

"example with available source code to demonstrate the presented "
