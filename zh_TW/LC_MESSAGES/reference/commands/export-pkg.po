"When creating a package for some closed source or pre-compiled binaries "
"provided by a vendor. In this case, it is not necessary that the ``conanfile."
"py`` recipe contains a ``build()`` method, and providing the ``package()`` "
"and ``package_info()`` method are enough to package those pre-compiled "
"binaries. In this case the ``build_policy = \"never\"`` could make sense to "
"indicate it is not possible to ``conan install --build=this_pkg``, as it "
"doesn't know how to build from sources when it is a dependency."

"When testing some recipe locally in the :ref:`local development "
"flow<local_package_development_flow>`, it can be used to quickly put the "
"locally built binaries in the cache to make them available to other packages "
"for testing, without needing to go through a full ``conan create`` that "
"would be slower."

"In general, it is expected that when ``conan export-pkg`` executes, the "
"possible Conan dependencies that were necessary to build this package had "
"already been installed via ``conan install``, so it is not necessary to "
"download dependencies at ``export-pkg`` time. But if for some reason this is "
"not the case, the command defines ``--remote`` and ``--no-remote`` "
"arguments, similar to other commands, as well as the ``--skip-binaries`` "
"optimization that could save some time installing dependencies binaries if "
"they are not strictly necessary for the current ``export-pkg``. But this is "
"the responsibility of the user, as it is possible that such binaries are "
"actually necessary, for example, if a ``tool_requires = \"cmake/x.y\"`` is "
"used and the ``package()`` method implements a ``cmake.install()`` call, "
"this will definitely need the binaries for the dependencies installed in the "
"current machine to execute."

"The ``conan export-pkg`` is a package creation command, it will create both "
"a new recipe and a new package binary, in the same way that the ``conan "
"create`` command does. Similarly, it will run after the creation of the "
"package any \"test-package\" functionality. If there is a ``test_package`` "
"folder besides the ``conanfile.py``, or a different test-package folder is "
"defined via the ``--test-folder/-tf`` argument or in the recipe "
"``test_package_folder`` attribute, then, such test-package will be triggered "
"to test and validate that the created package is usable by the simple "
"consumer project in the test-package folder."
