"The password is not stored in the client computer at any moment. Conan uses "
"`JWT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token>`_, so it gets a token "
"(expirable by the server) checking the password against the remote "
"credentials. If the password is correct, an authentication token will be "
"obtained, and that token is the information cached locally. For any "
"subsequent interaction with the remotes, the conan client will only use that "
"JWT token."
