"The ``build_id()`` method allows to re-use the same build to create "
"different binary packages in the cache, potentially saving build time as it "
"can avoid some unnecessary re-builds. It is therefore an optimization method."

"In the general case, there is one build folder for each binary package, with "
"the exact same ``package_id`` of the package. However this behavior can be "
"changed, there are a couple of scenarios that this might be useful:"

"The package build scripts generate several different configurations at once "
"(like both debug and release artifacts) in the same run, without the "
"possibility of building each configuration separately."

msgid ""
"The package build scripts generate one binary configuration, but different "
"artifacts that can be packaged separately. For example if there are some "
"test executables, you might want to create two packages: one just containing "
"the library for general usage, and another one also containing the tests "
"(for compliance, later reproducibility, debugging, etc)."

"This recipe will generate a final different package with a different "
"``package_id`` for debug and release configurations. But as the "
"``build_id()`` will generate the same ``build_id`` for any ``build_type``, "
"then just one folder and one ``build()`` will be done, building both debug "
"and release artifacts, and then the ``package()`` method will be called for "
"each configuration, and it should package the artifacts conditionally to the "
"``self.settings.build_type`` value. Different builds will still be executed "
"if using different compilers or architectures."

"This will only produce a different ``build_id`` if the package is for "
"Windows, thus running ``build()`` just once for all ``build_type`` values. "

"Conan strongly recommends to use one package binary with its own "
