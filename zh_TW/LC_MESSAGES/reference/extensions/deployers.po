"Deployers are a mechanism to facilitate copying files from one folder, "
"usually the Conan cache, to user folders. While Conan provides three built-"
"in ones (``full_deploy``, ``direct_deploy`` and ``runtime_deploy``), users "
"can easily manage their own with ``conan config install``."

"Deployers run before generators, and they can change the target folders. For "
"example, if the ``--deployer=full_deploy`` deployer runs before "
"``CMakeDeps``, the files generated by ``CMakeDeps`` will point to the local "
"copy in the user folder done by the ``full_deploy`` deployer, and not to the "
"Conan cache. Multiple deployers can be specified by supplying more than one "
"``--deployer=`` argument, and they will be ran in order of appearance."

"Deployers can be multi-configuration. Running ``conan install . --"
"deployer=full_deploy`` repeatedly for different profiles can achieve a fully "
"self-contained project, including all the artifacts, binaries, and build "
"files. This project will be completely independent of Conan and no longer "
"require it at all to build. Use the ``--deployer-folder`` argument to change "
"the base folder output path for the deployer as desired."
