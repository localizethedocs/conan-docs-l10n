"Generators are specific components that provide the information of "
"dependencies calculated by Conan in a suitable format for a build system. "
"They normally provide Conan users with a *conanbuildinfo.XXX* file that can "
"be included or injected to the specific build system. The file generated "
"contains information of dependencies in form of different variables and "
"sometimes function helpers too."
