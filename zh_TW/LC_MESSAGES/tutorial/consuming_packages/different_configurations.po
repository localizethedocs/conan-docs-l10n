"So far, we built a simple CMake project that depended on the **zlib** "
"library and learned about ``tool_requires``, a special type of "
"``requirements`` for build-tools like CMake. In both cases, we did not "
"specify anywhere that we wanted to build the application in *Release* or "
"*Debug* mode, or if we wanted to link against *static* or *shared* "
"libraries. That is because Conan, if not instructed otherwise, will use a "
"default configuration declared in the 'default profile'. This default "
"profile was created in the first example when we run the :command:`conan "
"profile detect` command. Conan stores this file in the **/profiles** folder, "
"located in the Conan user home. You can check the contents of your default "
