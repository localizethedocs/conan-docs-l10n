"As we learned in :ref:`previous sections <tutorial_creating_packages>` of "
"the tutorial, the most straightforward way to work when developing a Conan "
"package is to run :command:`conan create`. This means that every time it is "
"run, Conan performs a series of costly operations in the Conan cache, such "
"as downloading, decompressing, copying sources, and building the entire "
"library from scratch. Sometimes, especially with large libraries, while we "
"are developing the recipe, these operations cannot be performed every time."

"Finally, we will explain the **Conan package layouts** in depth. It is the "
"key feature that makes it possible to work with Conan packages in the Conan "
"cache or locally without making any changes."
