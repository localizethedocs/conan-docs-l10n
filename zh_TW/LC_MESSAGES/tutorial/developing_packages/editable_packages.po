"The normal way of working with Conan packages is to run a ``conan create`` "
"or ``conan export-pkg`` to store them in the local cache, so that consumers "
"use the packages stored in the cache. In some cases, when you want to "
"consume these packages while developing them, it can be tedious to run "
"``conan create`` each time you make changes to the package. For those cases, "
"you can put your package in editable mode, and consumers will be able to "
"find the headers and artifacts in your local working directory, eliminating "
"the need for packaging."
