"So basically, the super-project uses ``FetchContent`` to add the subfolders' "

"based subprojects with ``CMakeLists.txt``. Also, the subprojects must define "

"This super-build ``CMakeLists.txt`` defines dynamically the correct sub-"

"the different sub-projects in the correct build-order. While this is easy "
"for workspaces with very few packages, this can become a burden for larger "
"workspaces. The definition of the build-order is done in the generated "
"``conanws_build_order.cmake`` file, that is created by the ``conan workspace "
"super-install`` command calling the ``conanws.py`` workspace "
"``build_order()`` method. It is the responsibility of the workspace to "
"translate the information of the ``build_order()`` to specifics of the build "
"system. The exact implementation, like the ``conanws_build_order.cmake`` "
"file, is not a \"built-in\" workspace feature, note this is only the example "
