"The ``--all`` option will upload the package recipe plus all the binary "
"packages. Omitting the ``--all`` option will upload the package recipe "
"*only*. For fine-grained control over which binary packages are upload to "
"the server, consider using the ``--packages/-p`` or ``--query/-q`` flags. "
"``--packages`` allows you to explicitly declare which package gets uploaded "
"to the server by specifying the package ID. ``--query`` accepts a query "
"parameter, e.g. ``arch=armv8 and os=Linux``, and only uploads binary "
"packages which match this query. When using the ``--query`` flag, ensure "
"that your query string is enclosed in quotes to make the parameter explicit "
"to your shell. For example, ``conan upload <package> -q 'arch=x86_64 and "
"os=Linux' ...`` is appropriate use of the ``--query`` flag."
