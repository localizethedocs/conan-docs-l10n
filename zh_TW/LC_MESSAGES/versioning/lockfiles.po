"Lockfiles are files that store the information of a dependency graph, "
"including the exact versions, revisions, options, and configuration of that "
"dependency graph. These files allow for later achieving reproducible "
"results, and installing or using the exact same dependencies even when the "
"requirements are not fully reproducible, for example when using version "
"ranges or using package revisions."
