"Revisions achieve immutability. For achieving reproducible builds and "
"reproducible dependencies, **lockfiles** are used. Lockfiles can capture an "
"exact state of a dependency graph, down to exact versions and revisions, and "

"uploaded to the servers."

"When a **package** is created (by running :ref:`conan create<conan_create>` "

"will be calculated always using the hash of the package contents. The "
"packages and their revisions (PREVs) belongs to a concrete recipe revision "
